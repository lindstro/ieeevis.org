Due to a larger number of submissions (due to the changes in the pre-approved event structure) and topic overlap, the workshop chairs require more time to establish the right balance for workshops topics, presentation formats, workshop lengths (full vs half-day) etc.  The following workshops have been accepted, and we are working to conclude our reviews for the remainder. We ask for your patience and understanding as we conclude our review.

## Accepted Workshops

The IEEE VIS Workshop on Topological Data Analysis and Visualization aims at being an inclusive forum for the fast dissemination of the latest results in theory, algorithms, and applications of topological methods for the interactive and visual analysis of data. This workshop is a remodeling of the established TopoInVis workshop series, with the goal of being more diverse (in terms of applications) and inclusive (in terms of communities), with a clear will to open to other members of the visualization community potentially interested in topological methods, or experts in topological methods from other communities willing to experiment with interactive and visual applications.
