In this workshop, we aim at identifying potential strategies to achieve successful designs of interactive visualizations involving highly sought-after individuals, by leveraging practices and guidelines stemming from the experience of fellow researchers in the HCI and Visualization community. We consider "interactive" all visualizations that enable users to explore, manipulate and filter the information thereby encoded. We define End User Development (EUD) as an iterative process of co-creation that includes both the design and evaluation of such visualizations. During the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to learn about successful experiences directly from members of the research community, and partake in active discussions surrounding methods and approaches adopted in EUD practices.

Often the most transformative ideas and challenges come from unexpected and serendipitous sources. Yet, conferences are not often perceived as a place for non-traditional, controversial, or outré work. We propose to continue the success of the last three year's (2021, 2022, 2023) ``alt.VIS'' workshops that borrowed from the long-running and successful ``alt.chi'' model from the ACM SIGCHI conference. This venue will once again provide an avenue for surfacing creative or critical work that would otherwise not find a home through the standard VIS conference review process.

Uncertainty visualization has become an increasingly important topic given the ubiquity of noise in data and computational processes. This workshop proposal is motivated by the uncertainty visualization challenges identified during the 2024 IEEE Workshop on Uncertainty Visualization. Specifically, four research gaps were identified. First, uncertainty must be treated as data in its own right; however, visualization community currently lacks understanding of good ways to model uncertainty and propagate it through complex scientific workflows. Second, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive across scientific domains; however, it faces a major limitation of trustworthiness of predictions due to uncertainties propagated from the data and AI models. Third, there are no standard ways to effectively communicate uncertainty with end users who can be scientific or general audience. Finally, performing decision-making under uncertainty is an open challenge, considering the role of perception, cognition, and user expertise when interpreting uncertainty. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose to conduct another workshop on uncertainty visualization at IEEE VIS 2025. In particular, the overarching goal of the workshop is to create a roadmap to tackle the identified uncertainty visualization challenges that are multidisciplinary in nature by fostering interactions among experts from visualization, applications, AI, high-performance computing, applied math, and psychology fields.

This is the 3rd workshop on visualization education, literacy, and activities; after a succession of several successful workshops in 2023 and 2024 (30-50 people and 15-20 submissions annually). This workshop aims to become the primary forum to share and discuss advances, challenges, and methods at the intersection of visualization and education. It addresses an interdisciplinary audience from and beyond visualization, education, learning analytics, science communication, arts and design, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science and HCI. In its 3rd edition, we introduce annual spotlight topics, with this year's topic being Modalities of learning and engaging. This also includes topics of education for visualization (ed4vis) as well as visualization for education (vis4ed). We will pursue the \textbf{`educators reports'} track, which will be published in the Nightingale Magazine, and offer a paper track to be published in the IEEE Xplore library.

Following up on eight successful VIS4DH workshops, we propose the 9th workshop on Visualization for the Digital Humanities, co-located at IEEE VIS 2025 in Vienna, Austria. With VIS4DH, over the past decade, we have established a unique platform to present and discuss emerging topics at the intersection of the humanities, digital humanities (DH), and visualization research. With 70+ attendees on avg., all workshops---including the virtual ones---were well-received and have been drawing humanities researchers toward the VIS conference. This proposed workshop---VIS4DH'25---will continue and intensify this interdisciplinary exchange between scholars and practitioners from the humanities and visualization, actively addressing the question of how research at the intersection of related disciplines impacts the involved fields.

We propose a half-day workshop at IEEE VIS 2025 on addressing the emerging challenges in data-rich multimodal remote collaboration.
We focus on synchronous, remote, and hybrid settings where people take part in tasks such as data analysis, decision-making, and presentation. With this workshop, we continue successful prior work from the first MERCADO workshop at VIS 2023 and a 2024 Shonan Seminar that followed. Based on the findings of the earlier events, we invite research and ideas related to four themes of challenges: Tools & Technologies, Individual Differences & Interpersonal Dynamics, AI-assisted Collaboration, and Evaluation.
With this workshop, we aim to broaden the community, foster new collaborations, and develop a research agenda to address these challenges in future research. Our planned workshop format is comprised of a keynote, short presentations, a breakout group session, and discussions organized around the identified challenges.

Input visualization - visual representations that are designed to collect (and represent) new data rather than encode preexisting datasets - provides a new lens for direct interactions with data through visualizations and physicalizations. 
In stark contrast to existing conceptual models, input visualization recognizes the malleable, incomplete, and context-dependent nature of data, and highlights opportunities for new collaboration and thinking tools that increase users' agency while inverting the traditional power dynamics of data production. The input visualization paradigm opens up new opportunities for data analysis, digital civics, decision making, personal informatics, data discussion, planning, organization, and more. However, despite nascent research on data input in information visualization, there is a lack of understanding of the phenomenon broadly and the implications for designing new input visualization systems. In this workshop, we aim to gather the visualization, physicalization, and human-computer interaction,  community to establish a research agenda for input visualization and outline the challenges and opportunities offered by this approach.

It has been ten years since the term ``Immersive Analytics'' (IA) was coined and research interest in the topic remains strong. Researchers in this field have produced practical and conceptual knowledge concerning the use of emerging immersive spatial display and interaction technologies for sense-making tasks through a number of papers, surveys, and books. However, a lack of truly physically and psychologically ergonomic techniques, as well as standardized human-centric validation protocols for these, remains a significant barrier to wider acceptance of practical IA systems in ubiquitous applications. Building upon a series of workshops on immersive analytics at various conferences, this workshop aims to explore new approaches and establish standard practices for evaluating immersive analytics systems from a \textit{human factors} perspective. We will gather immersive analytics researchers and practitioners to look closely at these human factors---including cognitive and physical functions as well as behaviour and performance---to see how they inform the design and deployment of immersive analytics techniques and applications and to inform future research.

The ubiquity of data visualization across various domains—including data science, machine learning, business intelligence, medical science, and education—underscores its critical role in conveying complex information. However, it is now well-known that visualizations can create inequitable access to information for people with diverse disabilities, including vision, motor, and cognitive impairments. In response, the accessibility and visualization fields have increasingly focused on making data visualizations more accessible. Research in this area includes user studies with people with disabilities to understand access barriers, the development of theoretical frameworks, and the design of technical solutions such as autogenerated alt text, sonification, and tactile or physical artifacts. Despite these efforts, many visualization tools and interfaces remain inaccessible to users with disabilities. Building on the growing interest and persistent challenges at this intersection, the in-person Accessible Data Visualization (AccessViz) workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners, and members of the disability community on a shared platform to foster community, share innovative discoveries, and envision the future of accessible data visualization research at IEEE VIS. The outcome of this workshop will inspire new contributions and help establish a sustained research agenda around accessibility in visualization at IEEE VIS.

The integration of interactive Visual Analytics (VA) with explainable AI, multimodal data fusion, and privacy-preserving machine learning has become essential for interpreting the growing complexity of healthcare and biomedical data. Researchers and practitioners have expanded VA applications beyond traditional clinical decision support to encompass real-time patient monitoring, digital twin simulations, and AI-assisted diagnostics, addressing the needs of clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and patients. Since 2013, the VA in Healthcare (VAHC) workshop has been a key venue for interdisciplinary collaboration, adapting to rapid advancements in AI-driven and patient-centered healthcare. At VIS 2025, the workshop will continue to foster knowledge exchange by showcasing novel research, interactive demonstrations, and discussions on emerging challenges such as trustworthy AI in medical applications, federated data visualization, immersive analytics for surgical planning, large language model support, and equitable AI-driven decision-making. By bringing together experts from diverse fields, VAHC 2025 will serve as a catalyst for advancing the role of VA in shaping the future of intelligent, ethical, and human-centered healthcare.

The VISxAI workshop, throughout its past six iterations, has been a platform for knowledge exchange between researchers with different backgrounds interested in explaining machine learning models through visualization. Its focus on explainables submissions that visually and interactively explain machine learning concepts ranges in complexity from clustering methods to algorithmic biases. These explainables have served as educational resources that have had an impact beyond the academic community. The workshop also always hosted great keynote speakers that connected the domains of visualization and state-of-the-art machine learning and explored the impact visualization can have on explainability. For this upcoming iteration of VISxAI, our goal is to combine the success of interactive explainables and great presentations with the interactivity of breakout sessions and live demos. Participants will be encouraged to exchange ideas about the future of visual explainability, interactive articles, and explorable explanations. Furthermore, we will provide a platform for new visualization and interaction ideas that explain machine learning models.

This half-day workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to explore the evolving landscape of communicative visualization. Now in its seventh year (2018–2023), VisComm has consistently drawn vibrant, cross-sector participation and sparked conversations that extend beyond the event. This year, we focus on deepening our understanding of current design practices and strengthening collaboration between research and practice. Our goal is to advance the creation of visualizations that are aesthetically compelling, functionally robust, trustworthy, and
grounded in empirical evidence. To encourage participation from communities that do not typically attend IEEE VIS or write academic papers, we will invite various submission types, including short papers, work-in-progress briefs, visual case studies, and recruit program committee members from diverse communities. This year, we especially welcome contributions related to visualization style guides and how they are developed, used, and evaluated. By bringing together diverse perspectives on these guides, we aim to surface practical insights and build toward evidence-based recommendations that are both relevant and actionable.
