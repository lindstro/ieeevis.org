Please **read the following instructions carefully** for guidelines on preparing your **Presentation** for VIS 2025, or a VIS 2025 workshop.

## IEEE Visualization 2025 is planned as an in-person event

The focus of IEEE VIS 2025 are on on-site presentation. Nevertheless, virtual presentations are possible.
* **VIS Full/Short Papers**: Full and short papers will be split into in-person presenter-only and virtual presenter-only sessions. Both in-person and virtual session will be recorded. Authors should have made this selection during their camera ready submission. 
* **TVCG/CG&A Presentations**: TVCG/CG&A Presentations will be in-person presenter-only, but they will be recorded.
* **All Other Events**: Please contact the organizers of your event.

**All full/short paper and TVCG/CG&A presenters are required to register as a speaker, irrespective of their mode of presentation. Presenters at other events may register as attendees. Additionally, diversity and inclusivity scholarships will be available to support the participation of speakers with financial needs.**


## Presentation Recommendations and Powerpoint Template

We recommend using the provided 16x9 wide format (*PowerPoint template available soon*).

In addition, make sure that your presentation is accessible by speaking clearly, using large fonts, and ensuring high contrast. Avoid saying "as you can see on this slide" and always describe all relevant visuals. You can find some [recommendations for giving accessible talks from SIGACCESS](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) and if you have additional questions contact the [accessibility chairs](mailto:accessibility@ieeevis.org).

The VIS 2022 conference organizers put together some tips on making a compelling and informative talk, which still apply.  We hope that this guidance is helpful for your presentation:
