## Virtual Presentations

Virtual presentations at VIS 2025 are planned as videos that will be played at a specific time in a conference room.
A session chair will be available on site to introduce and play the videos.
Questions and answers will be conducted asynchronously in Discord.


## Prepare a Talk Video

If you are a virtual presenter, you will have to prepare a talk video.
Talk videos for full papers should be **9 minutes**. Talk videos for short papers should by **7 minutes**.

### Technical specification

All video submissions must meet the following requirements:
* MPEG-4 using H.264 encoding for video and AAC for audio (file extension must be .mp4)
* 1920x1080 resolution
* 16:9 aspect ratio: please make use of the full resolution, i.e., no black borders should be visible
* Frame rate of 30FPS
* Audio: Make sure that the quality of your voice recording is good and clearly understandable, without background noise and/or oversteering (stay below -5db). We discourage salient music to focus viewersâ€™ attention on the content and to avoid copyright issues.
* Make sure that any audio and video content is free from copyright or that you are licensed to use it. This is very important as YouTube automatically checks for copyright infringements.
* Optional: Subtitles. There are a number of tools that are available to generate captions for you, which you can download and include with your video. YouTube, Veed.io, and Facebook, for example, have free tools that automatically create closed captions and make it possible to download these.

### Video upload

Upload your talk video until **October 22nd, 2025** to the TU Wien Nextcloud service:
