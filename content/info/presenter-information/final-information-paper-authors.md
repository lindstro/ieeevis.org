This page provides authors of accepted **IEEE VIS Full Papers** with important information for the remainder of the process until the conference.

**IEEE VIS Short Papers** will follow a similar set of guidelines, with the exception that the paper length limits are shortened to 4+1 pages.

Authors of papers for **workshops** should check with their event organizers for specific information on deadlines and format.


## Camera-Ready Paper Submission

**DEADLINES: July 1 (Short Papers), August 8 (Full Papers)**

Submit final camera-ready papers and supplemental materials via the PCS submission system. Files submitted here are the default versions that we will use for preparing proceedings in IEEE Xplore and the downloadable content.

Camera-ready papers may not exceed 11 pages (full papers, 9 pages of main text and 2 pages of references) or 5 pages (short papers, 4 pages of main text and 1 page of references). The final two pages (full papers) or 1 page (short papers) can also include links to the Supplemental Material, Figure Credits, and Acknowledgements sections, in addition to references. Note that the Supplemental Material section in the paper should only include pointers to the material and explanation of what is included in that material, not the material itself; similarly, Figure Credits should only include credits, not actual figure material (images or captions). Papers may be shorter than this limit but must make a significant contribution (compared to the separate Short Papers program). See the [Paper Submission Guidelines](/year/2025/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines) for more details.

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure the final submission data in PCS is identical to the final PDF (e.g., title, author names and last names, affiliations, author order, email addresses.) You might need to correct the information in your PCS login in order to update the author information. You can do this by logging into your PCS account > my account > Change my contact information. The final author list has to be identical to the list that you provided for the abstract submission deadline (March 21). Note that if you have been anonymizing your submission, you may find you have to trim your text to fit into the page limits once authors and affiliations are added.

Please check the second round reviewer comments (if any) and incorporate their suggestions. Note: there will not be further detailed proofreading of your submission, so PLEASE read through your manuscript very carefully to fix any remaining grammar and spelling problems. We recommend finding an outside reader, such as a friend who is strong in English or someone from your institution’s writing center (if it exists), to do a careful editing pass on your paper.  

You can submit supplemental material (e.g. a video, appendix) for your work for inclusion in the digital archive. TVCG requires that supplemental material is also peer-reviewed, hence, this is only allowed if you have already submitted your supplemental material and if the reviewers have found it acceptable. Videos are usually up to 5 minutes in length, and you may also include other supplemental material such as additional images, appendices, or source code. 

The [VGTC website](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal) has complete information regarding formatting requirements of your final revised PDF. Common editing issues include:
- For full papers, use the [correct JOURNAL style template](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal). **Note: there was a new template in 2024**
- For short papers, use the [correct CONFERENCE style template](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/).
- Index terms are mandatory.
- For full papers, the abstract and index term sections use an em-dash between the heading and content; there should not be a space on either side of the em-dash and the content begins on the same line as the heading.
- Acknowledgment section—is it complete and correct?
- Titles: Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
- Inclusion of the “manuscript received” block on the bottom of page 1 exactly as is. The ‘xx’ placeholders should remain. They will be populated at a later date by TVCG.
- Do NOT include page numbers.
- Figure captions begin with “Fig. #” and go below the figure.  Captions should use 8pt Helvetica (sans serif) font.
- Table captions begin with “Table #.” and go above the table.  Captions should use 8pt Helvetica (sans serif) font.
- Figures should not be formatted vertically along a page and authors should not be stacking double column figures on top of single column figures, and vice versa.
- Text should not be wrapping around any figures, either.

You must also take a serious pass on the list of references at the end of the document for correctness, completeness, and consistency. That is, check each bibliographic entry for correctness (e.g., author names including special characters, publication years, publication type, page numbers vs. article numbers, etc.), completeness (all needed information for the respective entry type), and general consistency of reporting. Note that you cannot trust any web service (Google Scholar, Zotero, Mendeley, ...) or even digital library (even IEEE Xplore or ACM DL) for correct entries—cross-check every paper. In particular, ensure that all needed data is present. For conference papers (InProceedings): authors, title, proceedings name, publisher (short: e.g., "ACM" is fine) with town (short: e.g., no need for "New York, NY, USA"; "New York" is fine), page numbers or article number, DOI. For journal papers (Article): authors, title, journal name, volume, number (if exists), page numbers or article number, DOI. Please note, in particular, that VIS papers that appear in TVCG are frequently cited incorrectly: the year to be mentioned for these papers is not the year of presentation, but the year of publication of the respective special issue in TVCG (quick check: volume and year should either both be even or both be odd; if that's not the case the citation is wrong).

USE OF GENERATIVE AI: We remind you that, according to IEEE policy, the use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any article submitted to an IEEE publication (which does not count toward your page limit). The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is optional.

Please ensure that you have made your paper open access if your funding agency requires it (e.g., Plan S). We also highly recommend that all authors (1) upload their preprints to a free and open repository and (2) upload their supplemental material to a free, open, and long-term archive. Please see our [Open Practices page](/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices) for guidance on our requirements and recommendations.

Please see our [VIS Accessibility Guide](/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible) for recommendations for VIS 2025 authors on how to make your contribution accessible for broader audiences.


## Other Required Submission Items

Shortly after receiving final notifications from the second review cycle, the conference will send you an email from the Publications chairs with complete instructions. This email will be sent to the corresponding author for the paper and it will include a unique submission ID. Here is what to expect:

### 1. Speaker registration

All full papers are required to have one author register as a speaker, irrespective of whether they plan to present in person or virtually, and must be presented by that person. If exceptional circumstances prevent that person from presenting, please contact [the conference committee](mailto:program@ieeevis.org) as soon as possible.

### 2. Copyright Release

For papers that will be published in IEEE TVCG or on IEEE Xplore, authors are asked to complete a copyright release form. This will be handled via IEEE’s Conference Publishing Services (IEEE CPS) via a link provided to you via email.

### 3. Presentation Materials

Please see the [talk guide](/year/2025/info/presenter-information/talk-guide) for information on how to present your work at VIS 2025.
