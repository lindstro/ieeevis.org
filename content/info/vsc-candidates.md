# 2025 VIS Steering Committee (VSC) Candidates 
The VIS Steering Committee (VSC) provides scientific and organizational oversight of IEEE VIS. It is the highest level committee at IEEE VIS and develops long term strategy and policy, appoints scientific content chairs, manages relationships with journals, ratifies specified VEC appointments and decisions, and oversees the evolution of the area model that defines the conference.

The VSC provides oversight and planning for the VIS conference as described in the [VIS Charter](http://ieeevis.org/governance/IEEE-governance-structure).

The 2025 candidates for the VSC are:
* [Christoph Garth](#christoph-garth)
* [Enrico Bertini](#enrico-bertini)
* [Kyle Hall](#kyle-hall)

## Christoph Garth
"I am honored and excited to be nominated for a position on VSC! As an active member of the VIS community for two decades, I have served in a variety of organizing committee roles, including Poster Chair and Short Paper Chair, among others; currently, I am an Area Paper Chair. As a member and chair of the reVISe committee and the subsequent Area Curation Committee, I helped restructure the V-I-S landscape into the unified VIS conference and area model that we have today. Moreover, I currently serve as an Associate Editor for TVCG. My research is rooted in scientific visualization. With my group, I develop solutions that help our collaborators from science and industry to understand large and complex datasets. In doing so, I enjoy drawing on and contributing to the wide and diverse spectrum of tools and techniques that the visualization research ecosystem is offering. I have recently developed a passion for reproducibility and FAIR research practices, and I am striving to understand how visualization research can benefit from these, while keeping the burden on individual researchers low. As a TVCG Replicability Stamp reviewer for the past five years, I have helped authors ensure that their work is reproducible. I strongly believe that the VIS conference is the foremost international forum to build our community, exchange scientific ideas and results, and understand the impact of our research. On VSC, I would be strongly committed to foster and promote these core aspects, while seeking to adapt to new topics and challenges, with the input of the community. I am convinced that VIS can grow in size, diversity, and inclusivity, while continuing to improve as a high-quality yet accessible scientific conference. In my view, fostering scientific community is an important part of every researcher’s role. I would be thrilled to be able to take on this responsibility on VSC.

## Enrico Bertini
I am honored to be nominated for the Visualization Steering Committee position. If elected, I will do my best to provide innovative and responsible thinking for the scientific and organizational future of IEEE VIS. I have been an active community member for almost 20 years, participating and contributing as a PhD student first and then as a postdoc and faculty. Over the years, I have covered several organizational positions and have organized several events (panels, workshops, etc.), including co-founding the successful BELIV Workshop on evaluation in visualization, which became a pre-approved event at IEEE VIS. I am an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, affiliated with the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Art and Design. Previously, I was a faculty member at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. My research spans many areas of visualization, including applied, experimental, and theoretical work. Over the years, a large portion of my research has been devoted to the integration of automated and interactive methods in visualization. More recently, I have been focusing on the use of visualization as a way to understand the behavior of machine learning modes. I am a firm believer in the necessity of creating bridges between researchers and practitioners. For this reason, I have been active in building such bridges over the years. Most notably, in 2012, I started the Data Stories podcast (with Moritz Srefaner), which quickly became a major reference for the data visualization world across boundaries. If elected, I would be happy to promote initiatives that incentivize such exchanges and provide my expertise in the media space to expand the reach of IEEE VIS. In 2018, I developed an Information Visualization specialization for Coursera (made of 4 courses), providing training for thousands of people across the globe and contributing to educating people and supporting education across geographical boundaries. Education is crucial to training the future leaders of our community, and reaching people across geographical boundaries is essential to ensure everyone has a chance to contribute to our community. All these experiences, coupled with my long-standing contribution to visualization research, education, and outreach, can bring innovative elements and a unique outlook to IEEE VIS. I’d be delighted to make my experience available to the splendid IEEE VIS community to bring innovative elements and help sustain our future growth.

## Kyle Hall
Kyle has been involved in the VIS community for over a decade through serving on the VIS Core Committee as Archive Co-Chair, organizing the BELIV workshop three times, and his research contributions. Kyle is currently a Community Co-Chair. Following his time as an academic researcher, Kyle transitioned to industry where he led visualization R&D efforts for AI explainability. He has also spent the last few years building an industrial center of excellence for responsible AI and regulatory compliance oversight of GenAI and AI initiatives at a major North American bank while remaining embedded in VIS. If elected to the VSC, Kyle plans to focus on finding new ways to build bridges between VIS and industry, and enhance industrial participation at the conference, building off his connections to VIS and industrial experience. He also plans to explore avenues for increasing the profile of the VIS community in light of the need for quality human-AI interaction and the surge in AI adoption.
