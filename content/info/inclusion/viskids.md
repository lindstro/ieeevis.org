The IEEE VIS conference is excited to support our VISKids and young families! This year, we will be providing professional child care in the VISKids room. The conference will not be providing direct grants to conference attendees as in years past. 

## VISKids Room 

Throughout the duration of the conference, VISKids will have a room for provided daycare, play, and personal considerations (e.g., nursing). The room will be staffed by a professional child care agency, hired by the VIS conference. The child care staff will be on hand to operate the VISKids room as a daycare. More information will be shared on the child care agency once the organizers have finalized a contract. Rest asured, the number of staff will be appropriate for the number of expected children.

### VISKids Hello

Prior to the conference, we will give you the opportunity to connect with other VISKids parents to meet and greet and share plans for adventures in Vienna.

### Donate Toys to VISKids Room

We ask any attendees, especially locals, to donate toys to the VISKids Room. Any toys you decide to bring to the VISKids Room will be donated after the conference to a local childrens organization. Please do not drop off toys at the VISKids Room that you hope to get back.

If your child is attending VIS and wants to bring a toy, game, stuffed animal, etc. to the VISKids Room - please make sure they take it home with them at the end of each day. We don't want it to get lost in the collection of donated toys.

## VISKids Child Care Grants 

We will not provide a childcare grants program as in years past. This year, the decision has been made to staff the VISKids Room with professional childcare. The VISKids Room will operate as a daycare to support families attending VIS.
