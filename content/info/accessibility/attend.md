IEEE VIS seeks to cultivate an environment that encourages participation and inclusion.

## Communicating accessibility needs

During registration, you can indicate that you have accessibility needs. We will follow up with you to discuss your needs in more detail. If you find that any of the online platforms do not support your needs, you can contact [accessibility@ieeevis.org](mailto:accessibility@ieeevis.org), and we will work with you to ensure you can participate on the platforms.

## Accessibility considerations

We have made efforts to ensure that the pre-recorded video presentations and streamed sessions include captioning.

All live events in the main sessions will be captioned by professional stenographers. The recorded talks are also captioned. Workshops and supplementary live events will not be captioned.

If you have a problem with accessibility during the event, please contact [accessibility@ieeevis.org](mailto:accessibility@ieeevis.org), and we will try to resolve your issue.
