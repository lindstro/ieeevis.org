The VIS 2025 keynote talk will be given by **Hans-Christian Hege**.

Hans-Christian studied physics and mathematics at the University of Berlin.
He was then employed as a research associate at the Institute for the Theory of Elementary Particles at the same university, working in the field of quantum field theory.
In 1986, he founded the company *Mental Images*, where he worked as a leading scientist in software development until 1989.
From 1989 to 2020, Hege worked as a scientist at the [Zuse-Institute Berlin (ZIB)](https://www.zib.de/de/members/hege){:target="_blank"}.
Hans-Christian was awarded the IEEE VGTC Lifetime Achievement Award in 2024.

In his keynote talk "*The Science of Visual Insight: Transforming Data Visualization into a Rigorous Discipline*", Hans-Christian will focus on the foundations of data visualization.
Data visualization is not yet a fully established science, but rather a practice or discipline based on insights from fields such as computer science, data analysis, design, perception, and cognition.
To elevate data visualization to the rank of a science, it needs a philosophical foundation, a scientific core, and a rigorous methodology.
His keynote talk will outline some of the gaps that need to be filled in order to achieve this.
