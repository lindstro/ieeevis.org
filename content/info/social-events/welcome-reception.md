The VIS 2025 **Welcome Reception** will take place outside the convention center.

## Location

We cordially invite you to the welcome reception at the **Natural History Museum** in Vienna's 1st district.
The Natural History Museum Vienna is located in a neo-renaissance building that was constructed between 1871 and 1889.
It is considered one of the largest and most important museums in the world.

The welcome reception includes **drinks and finger food**. Admission is with your conference badge.
The museum is reserved exclusively for us.

Please note that the Natural History Museum is one of two museums on *Maria-Theresien-Platz* that look exactly the same (the other is the Art History Museum).
Even Viennese people regularly confuse the two buildings.
There is a bronze elephant statue in front of the Natural History Museum.
If you do not see the elephant, you are at the wrong museum - just turn around and go to the other building.


## When

The welcome reception will take place:

**Tuesday (Nov 4), 6:30pm - 9:00pm (CET)**
