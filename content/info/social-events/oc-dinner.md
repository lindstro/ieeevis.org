The VIS **OC Dinner** is intended as a thank-you to the whole VIS organization committee.
Therefore, the dinner is by **invitation only**.


## Location

The OC Dinner will take place at the **Melker Stiftskeller** restaurant in Vienna's 1st district.
The restaurant is located in a very old building.
In 1774, the new *Melkerhof* was built in the 1st district at its current location.
A document from 1629 proves that even the building before, the old *Melkerhof*, was connected to a wine cellar.
This wine cellar developed into today's **Melker Stiftskeller**, which serves exquisite Viennese cuisine.

We will have a **buffet and drinks**.
