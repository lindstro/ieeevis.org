2025 is a special anniversary year celebrating the development of a visual language.
One hundred years ago, **Otto Neurath** and his team in Vienna began developing what would become **ISOTYPE** - short for the *International System of Typographic Picture Education*.
The underlying principles of the ISOTYPE system still resonate in today’s visualization guidelines.

To remember the work of Otto Neurath and his team, we will present an **ISOTYPE exhibition** in the convention center.
