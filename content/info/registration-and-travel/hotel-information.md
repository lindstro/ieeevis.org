Vienna has more than 430 hotels with more than 40,000 rooms to suit all tastes and budgets.
**We encourage you to explore Vienna's hotel landscape and find an accommodation that suits you best!**

## Searching for a hotel

There are two recommended places to stay in Vienna:
* Either **close to the convention center**, or
* In or somewhere near to the **city center**.

The first option allows you to walk to the conference, but you will not find any options for dinner or drinks in the evening near the convention center.
The second option allows you to stay close to the main sights and find many restaurant and bar options, but you will have to take the subway to get to the conference.
The Austria Center Vienna is next to the **U1** subway station "Kaisermühlen - Vienna International Center".
So, when searching for a hotel near the city center, it is highly recommended that you pick one that is close to a U1 subway station (or any other subway line that directly connects to U1).

## Pre-booked rooms

We also pre-booked some rooms in Vienna, in case you don't want to search for a hotel on your own.
Room blocks are not tied to the conference organization. If room allotments are not claimed, they will be returned to the hotels.
