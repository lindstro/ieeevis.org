### Directions

The Austria Center Vienna (ACV) can be easily reached by public transport:
* **On Foot**: There are hotels nearby if you would like to stay close to the convention center.
* **Public Transport**: The convention center is located next to the **U1** subway station "Kaisermühlen - Vienna International Center". Please note: The "Vienna International Center" is not the venue; it is the headquarters of the United Nations, right next to it.
* **Vienna Airport Lines**: The ACV is directly connected to the line VAL 3 of the [Vienna Aiport Lines](https://www.viennaairportlines.at/){:target= "_blank"}.
* **Onsite Car Parking**: If driving to the convention center, parking is available but needs to be paid extra.
* **Taxi and Rideshare**: Taxi and rideshares are generally available.


### Remarks for access from the subway station

If you go to the convention center by subway, take the station exit near the rear end of the subway (in the direction out of town).
After exiting the subway station, turn right. The stairs after the pedestrian crossing will lead you to the ACV.
The other subway exit (near the top end of the subway train heading out of town) directly leads to the Vienna International Center, the headquarters of the United Nations in Austria.
If you find yourself suddenly in front of security control and someone is asking for your passport, you took the wrong exit :)
Just turn around and take the other exit.


### Rooms

The main conference events will take place at level 0 (entrance level). You will also find the registration desk on this level. Coffee breaks will take place at level 0.
