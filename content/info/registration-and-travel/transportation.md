## Getting Around

When picking up your conference badge, you will be handed out a [Vienna Meeting Ticket](https://meeting.vienna.info/en/why-vienna/getting-around-vienna/wiener-linien-vienna-meeting-ticket-435604){:target="_blank"} for the Vienna public transportation system ([Wiener Linien](https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en){:target="_blank"}).
The Vienna Meeting Ticket enables participants to make unlimited use of all means of public transport in Vienna (*Kernzone Wien*) for the entire duration of the event.

Unfortunately, because we are an event with less than 3,000 people, the regulations of the Wiener Linien do not allow to send you this ticket beforehand.
So, for travelling to the conference venue for picking up your badge, we ask you to make your own travel arrangements.
The easiest and cheapest option is to buy a single ticket (â‚¬2.40) which is valid for one ride ([Wiener Linien Shop](https://shop.wienmobil.at/en/products){:target="_blank"}).

## Austrian and Viennese participants

**For Austrian and Viennese participants only**:
If you already have a ticket for the Wiener Linien (*Jahrekarte* or *Klimaticket*), please do not pick up a Vienna Meeting Ticket at registration.
Vienna Meeting Tickets that are not needed will be returned to Wiener Linien, and we won't have to pay for them.
