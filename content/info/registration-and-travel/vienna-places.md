Vienna impresses with its excellent (meeting) infrastructure, short distances, reliable standards, high service quality and an outstanding range of art and culture. The city combines tradition and modernity - historical flair in a smart and livable city that is constantly evolving.

The Austrian capital regularly leads the international livable city rankings - including the Global Liveability Index published by the United Kingdomâ€™s Economist Group, which it topped once again in 2024. In its latest report, the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) awarded the city fourth place in the 2023 ICCA Ranking - Destination Performance Index (DPI), while the Union of International Associations (UIA) ranked Vienna second.
