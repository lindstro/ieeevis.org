The IEEE VIS 2025 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

The presentation of posters will happen as a physical event at the conference. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions where poster authors can meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will supplement the traditional physical installation of poster boards. 

Examples of appropriate visualization work include but are not limited to

* research exploring new problems or areas,
* results of pilot projects,
* new angles on existing (collections of) work or known datasets,
* work-in-progress presented prior to its full publication,
* any work that might particularly benefit from demonstration to and
  active discussion with the visualization community,
* the application of visualization techniques to
  specific application areas, and 
* highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue.


**UPDATE**: Check out our [Poster design guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PbI4gt3JkoMpv0a8nr_S8YSYgQUPmjfBsezIYITxow/edit?tab=t.0).

### INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Poster authors must submit a two-page (including references) summary of their work in the [VGTC conference two-column format](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference), using the poster format in line with the IEEE VIS Posters’ formatting guidelines.

Summaries should include a concise description of the idea, the results or findings, supporting imagery and figures, and a discussion of the implications of the work to the selected domain. Full literature searches are not expected, although relevant citations should be included.

The poster design itself **does not** need to be submitted with the the summary on the initial submission deadline. Instead, authors whose poster summaries are accepted will be asked to submit their poster as a PDF at the camera-ready deadline. Authors of accepted posters will also need to bring a physical printed copy of their poster to display at the poster session at the conference. (See details below.)

Posters are non-archival, and the 2-page summaries will not be included in the conference proceedings. However, the posters themselves will be shared online as part of the conference program. Authors are free to share non-archival copies of their posters and summaries on their own personal/lab websites or online preprint repositories. 

### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All posters will be submitted via [Precision Conference (PCS)](https://new.precisionconference.com/). 

After logging into PCS, navigate to the "Submissions" view and start your submission by selecting "VGTC > VIS 2025 > VIS 2025 Posters".

### PLAGIARISM
All submissions must be either: 1) original work that has not been presented previously at any workshop, symposium, or conference and not published previously in any archived conference proceeding, magazine, or journal or 2) a summary that highlights work presented or published by the authors in a related venue with a clear statement of attribution to the original work.

At the time of submission, the authors are required to state explicitly in the submission form that the submitted work is the work of the authors themselves or is a summary of the authors’ previously presented/published work with clear attribution. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and will lead to the removal of the submission from the review process. For more information, please see the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/plagiarism.html) and the [IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual](https://pspb.ieee.org/images/files/files/opsmanual.pdf). 

### IMPORTANT DATES
* Submission Deadline: **Tuesday, June 24, 2025**
* Notification of Acceptance: **Thursday, July 24, 2025**
* Final Submission of camera-ready (1) 2-page Poster Summary PDF and (2) full Poster PDF: **Thursday, August 21, 2025**

All deadlines are at 11:59 pm (23:59) AoE **Anywhere on Earth [(AoE)](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth)**.

### POSTER DESIGN AND PRINTING
VIS has no specific formatting requirements or template for display posters. However, all posters should include the same title and authors as the 2-page poster summary and should be legible from a distance of 2 meters. Posters can be no larger than A0 format (33''x48'') in a portrait orientation. If planning to laminate your poster, make sure you leave the requisite margin on all sides. The conference will supply poster boards and supplies for mounting. 

**UPDATE**: Check out our [Poster design guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PbI4gt3JkoMpv0a8nr_S8YSYgQUPmjfBsezIYITxow/edit?tab=t.0) to help you create a clear and compelling poster. <!--A PDF copy of the display poster must be submitted on PCS by the camera-ready deadline for inclusion in the online program. -->
A PDF copy of your display poster **can be submitted through PCS with alongside the paper poster** at the regular deadline (June 24) to obtain formative feedback from reviewers. This feedback, however, has no implications on the whether the poster is accepted of rejected. It is purely informative to help you improve your poster. 

The final display poster **must be** submitted alongside the final camera ready version for any accepted poster. 

For authors who do not wish to travel with their posters, several printing shops are available in Vienna. Prints can be ordered and picked up from the store. More information is coming soon about this. 

### ACCESSIBILITY

All poster PDFs should adhere to the [IEEE VIS Accessibility Guidelines](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible) and should be designed and formatted to ensure they can be easily accessed by a wide audience, particularly members of the community who rely on screen readers. 

Given the highly visual nature of VIS Posters, all authors should take care to:
* Augment your PDF to add alt text for all images.
* Tag PDF heading and paragraph text and verify reading order. 
* Avoid flattening multiple images into a single image collage.
* Avoid "baking" text into images where it can't be read by screen readers. 
* Make sure any QR codes are also clickable hyperlinks in the PDF document and/or are accompanied by a printed URL. 

Yin et al.'s ACM DIS 2024 publication ["Malicious Pictorials": How Alt Text Matters to Screen Reader Users' Experience of Image-Dense Media.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3643834.3660747) (and especially their "Accessibility Patterns for Image-Dense Media"-page 8) contains a number of additional details and suggestions specific to image-centric documents like posters. 

### POSTER SESSION

There will be 1-2 dedicated poster presentation sessions throughout the week in which the posters will be presented. During these times, one or more authors have to be available physically at their poster to discuss their work. More details will follow soon.

### POSTER REVIEW PROCESS

Poster submissions are single-blind and do not need to be anonymized. Submissions will be reviewed using a juried process, during which each poster will be read and evaluated by at least two reviewers, with final decisions made collectively by the Posters Chairs.  Authors will receive reviews of their submissions explaining the decision and providing feedback. Authors of accepted posters are expected to address any recommendations and conditions of acceptance prior to final submission.

### BEST POSTER AWARDS 

The Best Poster Awards will recognize the most outstanding poster contributions. It will be based on (1)  the significance of the research contributions described in the submitted two-page poster summaries, as well as (2) the clarity, creativity, and design of the poster. These awards will be noted in the program and presented with a signed certificate.
