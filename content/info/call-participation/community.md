Our goals in Community are organizing activities at IEEE VIS conference that connect the current and next generation of visualization researchers and practitioners. We do this by providing conference activities to participants for all of the various visualization sub-communities: scientific visualization, information visualization, visual analytics, industry, etc. 

The Community activities are open to all registered IEEE VIS participants, regardless of seniority and affiliation. The activities are organized by the IEEE VIS Community Chairs, who can be reached at [community@ieeevis.org](community@ieeevis.org).

This year, Community will host the following events and activities:

* [VisBuddies Meetup](#visbuddies)
* [Job-Fair Meetup](#ajf)
* [Job Flyer Online Posting](#job-flyers)

### <a name="visbuddies"></a>VisBuddies Meetup



VisBuddies brings together new and returning VIS attendees with similar interests. For *newcomers*, this is a chance to meet experienced researchers in the field. For *returning attendees*, it is a chance to meet new members joining VIS and welcome them into our community. 

Example VisBuddies activities include:
* Build connections between experienced researchers and new members of the VIS community
* Discuss interesting sessions to attend
* Share tips on successful research
