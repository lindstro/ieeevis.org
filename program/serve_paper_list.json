[{"abstract":"Scatterplots are among the most popular visualization methods for bivariate or multivariate data. While scatterplots scale well with the number of samples, visual clutter cannot be avoided with increasing data size. Density regularization is a common approach to declutter scatterplots. However, most existing density-equalizing algorithms are restricted to rectangular domains, which limits their applicability. In particular, they cannot operate within interactive lenses, a widely used approach for interactive data exploration. We present a numerical approach that generalizes density-equalizing transformations to domains of arbitrary shape, including concave regions. The definition of the regions of interest can be data-driven or interactive. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by implementing adaptive and flexible interactive lenses for enhanced data exploration in scatterplots, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader application.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"molchano@uni-muenster.de","name":"Vladimir Molchanov"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"hennes.rave@uni-muenster.de","name":"Hennes Rave"},{"affiliation":"University of M\u00fcnster","email":"linsen@uni-muenster.de","name":"Lars Linsen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"molchano@uni-muenster.de","name":"Vladimir Molchanov"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.388939+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a93e5d17-6b6f-48f8-a943-8abfdd53c3c1","image_caption":"This paper may be of interest to data scientists who develop interactive visual analytics systems that use scatterplots to display and explore complex data.","keywords":["Clutter reduction","scatterplots","density equalization","virtual lenses."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1338-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzMzgtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY4fQ.PP_Jb1Fsu3bSMhRSpFrN_DBYeyCr6xBK6ybnuqYcDfE","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1338-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=6414079042bc5f7ac19afccfcbd6a3152e3e6fa5254128bc7fb47d81473c9626","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1338-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=a5fc19bb1ed790dcb8d4be13037f8a91973dcdac1dc738dd5d1a228d7746d6ac","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1338","title":"A Decluttering Lens for Scatterplots","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:31.063073+00:00"},{"abstract":"Designing multiscale visualizations, particularly when the ratio between the largest scale and the smallest item is large, can be challenging, and designers have developed many approaches to overcome this challenge. We present a design space for visualization with multiple scales. The design space includes three dimensions, with eight total subdimensions. We demonstrate its descriptive power by using it to code approaches from a corpus we compiled of 52 examples, created by a mix of academics and practitioners. We demonstrate descriptive power by analyzing and partitioning these examples into four high-level strategies for designing multiscale visualizations, which are shared approaches with respect to design space dimension choices. We demonstrate generative power by analyzing missed opportunities within the corpus of examples, identified through analysis of the design space, where we note how certain examples could have benefited from different choices. We discuss patterns in the use of different dimension and strategy choices in the different visualization contexts of analysis and presentation. \n\nSupplemental materials: https://osf.io/wbrdm/\n\nDesign space website: https://marasolen.github.io/multiscale-vis-ds/","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"The University of British Columbia","email":"marasolen@gmail.com","name":"Mara Solen"},{"affiliation":"The University of British Columbia","email":"moddo@eoas.ubc.ca","name":"Matt Oddo"},{"affiliation":"University of British Columbia","email":"tmm@cs.ubc.ca","name":"Tamara Munzner"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"marasolen@gmail.com","name":"Mara Solen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"09fe1b80-d4a6-454e-bd5f-d49b53eae041","image_caption":"Visualization designers working on large or multiscale datasets may be interested in the paper as they could learn about different design options and strategies for constructing effective visualizations.","keywords":["Visualization","design space","multiscale."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/wbrdm/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1085-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTA4NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjJ9.W0kqN9YKAInjxiiCZX0x-etAzhYVHXsxF2c8acOwJjE","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1085-cam-i10.xlsx?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=f140ad8347c0a7d9bd6ea530534d926edee88e69b282f81eebb07210877c1d80","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1085-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=ed56d4e52c34225a0448c9e10c018339e7934c9b591c27388068d9c4034fa8ed","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01485","program_paper_id":"1085","title":"A Design Space for Multiscale Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:01:02.787415+00:00"},{"abstract":"Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"hbraun5@wisc.edu","name":"Halle Braun"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","email":"kushinm11@gmail.com","name":"Kushin Mukherjee"},{"affiliation":"Woodwell Climate Research Center","email":"sgorelik@woodwellclimate.org","name":"Seth Gorelik"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c9fcc45e-0f81-49be-817e-b813e0b61c89","image_caption":"Practitioners who use color in visualization design may be interested in our findings on factors that influence the affective (emotional) connotation of colormap data visualizations.

Making a good schematic transit map is challenging and labour-intensive, and has attracted the attention of the optimization community. Much of the literature has focused on mathematically defining an optimal drawing and algorithms to compute one. However, achieving these optimal layouts is computationally challenging, often requiring multiple minutes of runtime. Crucially, what it means for a map to be good is actually highly dependent on factors that evade a general formal definition, like unique landmarks within the network, the context in which a map will be displayed, and the preference of the designer and client. Rather than attempting to make an algorithm that produces a single high-quality and ready-to-use metro map at great cost, we propose it is more fruitful to support rapid layout iteration by a human designer, providing a workflow that enables efficient exploration of a wider range of designs than could be done by hand, and iterating on these designs. To this end we identify steps in the design process of schematic maps that are tedious to do by hand but are algorithmically feasible, and present a framework around a simple linear program that computes network layouts almost instantaneously given a fixed direction for every connection. These connection directions are decided by a designer in a graphical user interface with several interaction methods and a number of quality-of-life features demonstrating the flexibility of the framework; the implementation is available as open source.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas van Dijk"},{"affiliation":"TU Eindhoven","email":"s.d.terziadis@tue.nl","name":"Soeren Terziadis"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"tvdmaps@gmail.com","name":"Thomas van Dijk"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f53bf658-7b1b-4417-9c0c-0b74e7455702","image_caption":"Graphic designers and information designers might find our tool useful to design schematic layouts of (transit) networks.

Although recent studies have examined how text elements (e.g., titles and annotations) influence comprehension, preferences, and predictions, many questions remain about textual design and use in practice. This paper introduces a framework for understanding text functions in information visualizations, building on and filling gaps in prior classifications and taxonomies. Through an analysis of 120 real-world visualizations and 804 text elements, we identified ten distinct text functions, ranging from identifying data mappings to presenting valenced subtext. We further identify patterns in text usage and conduct a factor analysis, revealing four overarching text-informed design strategies: Attribution and Variables, Annotation-Centric Design, Visual Embellishments, and Narrative Framing. In addition to these factors, we explore features of title rhetoric and text multifunctionality, while also uncovering previously unexamined text functions, such as text replacing visual elements. Our findings highlight the flexibility of text, demonstrating how different text elements in a given design can combine to communicate, synthesize, and frame visual information. This framework adds important nuance and detail to existing frameworks that analyze the diverse roles of text in visualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley","email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"aarunku5@asu.edu","name":"Anjana Arunkumar"},{"affiliation":"UC Berkeley","email":"hearst@berkeley.edu","name":"Marti Hearst"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","name":"Lace Padilla"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","name":"Chase Stokes"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9188996c-0f8f-420b-95eb-1cf466e3fa0d","image_caption":"This paper would be interesting to data journalists, consultants, analysts, and any other roles which create charts for communication purposes.

Our work is inspired by the growing number of empirical studies in visualization research that rely on visualization literacy as a basis for developing effective data representations or educational interventions. Researchers have already made various efforts to assess this construct, yet it is often hard to pinpoint either what we want to measure or what we are effectively measuring. In this autoethnography, we gather insights from 14 internal interviews with researchers who are users or designers of visualization literacy tests. We aim to identify what makes visualization literacy assessment a wicked problem. We further reflect on the fluidity of visualization literacy and discuss how this property may lead to misalignment between what the construct is and how measurements of it are used or designed. We also examine potential threats to measurement validity from conceptual, operational, and methodological perspectives. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose several calls to action aimed at tackling the wicked problem of visualization literacy measurement, such as by broadening test scopes and modalities, improving test ecological validity, making it easier to use tests, seeking interdisciplinary collaboration, and drawing from continued dialogue on visualization literacy to expect and be more comfortable with its fluidity.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"wanqian.ge@northwestern.edu","name":"Lily Ge"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Inria, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, CNRS, LISN, i3","email":"acabouat@gmail.com","name":"Anne-Flore Cabouat"},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","email":"kbonilla@wpi.edu","name":"Karen Bonilla"},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"yuancui2025@u.northwestern.edu","name":"Yuan Cui"},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","email":"yding5@wpi.edu","name":"Yiren Ding"},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","email":"ntrakotondravony@wpi.edu","name":"No\u00eblle Rakotondravony"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"18mcreamer@gmail.com","name":"Mackenzie Creamer"},{"affiliation":"UC Santa Cruz","email":"jtotto@ucsc.edu","name":"Jasmine Otto"},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"maryam.hedayati@u.northwestern.edu","name":"Maryam Hedayati"},{"affiliation":"IBM Research","email":"bumchul.kwon@us.ibm.com","name":"Bum Chul Kwon"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Brescia","email":"angela.locoro@unibs.it","name":"Angela Locoro"},{"affiliation":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","email":"ltharrison@wpi.edu","name":"Lane Harrison"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN","email":"petra.isenberg@inria.fr","name":"Petra Isenberg"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"m.correll@northeastern.edu","name":"Michael Correll"},{"affiliation":"Northwestern University","email":"matthew.kay@u.northwestern.edu","name":"Matthew Kay"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wanqian.ge@northwestern.edu","name":"Lily W.

The manual labor required to create useful annotations is a barrier that keeps users from documenting their analysis, especially intermediate results. To address the needs of exploration and annotation alike, we propose integrating annotation with lens-based interactions, combining both with guidance. We investigate the exploration-annotation requirement space, identifying challenges and extracting five design requirements for annotation in exploration contexts. Based on this investigation, we designed ANNOLENS\u2014a concrete instantiation of such a system that lets users explore and annotate dimensionality-reduced multivariate data. It employs a dual-lens approach for contrastive exploration, using guidance to steer users toward interesting data subsets and attributes. Annotation is directly integrated into the lenses, letting users quickly annotate hunches and discoveries. Automated merging and linking serve to simplify annotation management and reduce disruptions. In a pilot study, we conducted a preliminary evaluation of our approach, which indicated that users find it easy to annotate data and were able to incorporate their knowledge and unique perspective into the process.

Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"pdu@nd.edu","name":"Pan Du"},{"affiliation":"Cornell University","email":"jw2837@cornell.edu","name":"Jian-Xun Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dan3@nd.edu","name":"Delin An"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8330bc4e-c9eb-41e0-8fa0-8043f0518241","image_caption":"Researchers whose work focuses on medical image processing, computational fluid dynamics simulation, and aortic visualization will find this paper of interest.

However, traditional visual interfaces often rely on specialized graphical representations and interactions, which require additional effort to learn and use. Natural language interaction offers a more intuitive alternative, but teaching machines to recognize diverse scientific concepts and extract corresponding structures from flow data poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that aligns flow pattern representations with the semantic space of large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our approach encodes streamline segments using a denoising autoencoder and maps the generated flow pattern representations to LLM embeddings via a projector layer. This alignment empowers semantic matching between textual embeddings and flow representations through an attention mechanism, enabling the extraction of corresponding flow patterns based on textual descriptions. To enhance accessibility, we develop an interactive interface that allows users to query and visualize flow structures using natural language. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling intuitive and intelligent flow exploration.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhangwh79@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Weihan Zhang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"d207baab-2afc-4d7a-bbfd-cf81768ec83c","image_caption":"Practitioners such as scientific data visualization researchers, tool developers, and domain scientists working with flow data would be interested in this paper.","keywords":["Flow visualization","natural language","streamlines"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1349-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTM0OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDF9.d7dYMhp-Uu-tkqZQ1ig5gA93c_Q0FNir7YOBF4qaong","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1349-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=39129b8f44dda8bde5c9240398271dc910605b8eca7d005253f2a929a5a1656a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1349-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=de3cc4c4533225c2312bb3eff3f03cf595fe24e78311f42d1fe2fc244478d6c9","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06300","program_paper_id":"1349","title":"Automatic Semantic Alignment of Flow Pattern Representations for Exploration with Large Language Models","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:12:23.09828+00:00"},{"abstract":"Balaton Borders translates ecological data from Lake Balaton into ceramic tableware that represents human impact on the landscape, from reedbed reduction to shoreline modification and land erosion.

We present BDIViz, a novel visual analytics system designed to streamline the schema matching process for biomedical data. Through formative studies with domain experts, we identified key requirements for an effective solution and developed interactive visualization techniques that address both scalability challenges and semantic ambiguity. BDIViz employs an ensemble approach that combines multiple matching methods with LLM-based validation, summarizes matches through interactive heatmaps, and provides coordinated views that enable users to quickly compare attributes and their values. Our method-agnostic design allows the system to integrate various schema matching algorithms and adapt to application-specific needs. Through two biomedical case studies and a within-subject user study with  domain experts, we demonstrate that BDIViz significantly improves matching accuracy while reducing cognitive load and curation time compared to baseline approaches.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"d.turakhia@nyu.edu","name":"Dishita Turakhia"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"guandewu@nyu.edu","name":"Guande Wu"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"christos.koutras@nyu.edu","name":"Christos Koutras"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"sarah.keegan@nyulangone.org","name":"Sarah Keegan"},{"affiliation":"New York University School of Medicine","email":"wenke.liu@nyulangone.org","name":"Wenke Liu"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"beata.szeitz@nyulangone.org","name":"Beata Szeitz"},{"affiliation":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine","email":"david.fenyo@nyulangone.org","name":"David Fenyo"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"eden.wu@nyu.edu","name":"Eden Wu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"e8f720e9-fa87-43c1-9d57-b8cc150f3cd3","image_caption":"Data Scientist, Biomedical Researchers","keywords":["Schema matching","Biomedical data harmonization","Data visualization","User-in-the-loop","LLM-based schema matching"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-viz","open_access_supplemental_question":"Our work provides a reproducible pipeline, including thoroughly documented source code, public Docker images for streamlined deployment, and a live server that allows users to directly interact with the system.

Focusing on bar charts, we incorporate cognitive insights into visualization design to better align with how humans perceive OMVs. Studies in cognitive psychology suggest that, for large numerical ranges such as millions and billions, people do not think logarithmically. Instead, they perceive numbers in a piecewise linear manner, grouping values into scale words (e.g., millions) and applying linear reasoning within each group. We build upon a recently introduced piecewise linear scale, EplusM, and validate its use in bar charts, which we refer to as EplusM bar charts. We also introduce two novel variants of the EplusM bar chart informed by findings in numerical perception: Bricks, which builds on the concepts of round numbers and subitizing, and Multi-Magnitude, which leverages categorical perception of large numbers. In a crowdsourced experiment, we evaluate four bar chart designs: 1) Log, 2) EplusM, 3) Bricks, and 4) Multi-Magnitude, across value retrieval and quantitative comparison tasks. Our results show that EplusM bar charts are significantly preferred over logarithmic designs, increase user confidence, and reduce perceived mental demand, while maintaining task performance. These findings suggest that EplusM bar charts can serve as effective alternatives to logarithmic ones when visualizing OMVs for general audiences.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"},{"affiliation":"Berger-Levrault","email":"reystef@gmail.com","name":"St\u00e9phanie Rey"},{"affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Inria, LISN","email":"jean-daniel.fekete@inria.fr","name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kbatziakoudi@gmail.com","name":"Katerina Batziakoudi"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"80f2d2e8-877c-469a-8ce2-bb3e5bea1f93","image_caption":"This paper would be valuable to any practitioner who needs to visualize quantitative data spanning multiple orders of magnitude for general audiences\u2014a common challenge in domains such as finance, healthcare, public policy, environmental science, and science communication.

In contrast, research in other design disciplines has emphasized the importance of framing---how designers define and redefine what the problem is---and the co-evolution of problem and solution spaces through reflective practice. These dimensions remain underexplored in visualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert practitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame problems and navigate the interplay between problem understanding and solution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert design practitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured interviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies that participants used to frame design problems, reframe them in response to evolving constraints or insights, and construct bridges between problem and solution spaces. These included the use of metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and reflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas. Our findings contribute an empirically grounded account of visualization design as a reflective, co-evolutionary practice. We show that framing is not a preliminary step, but a continuous activity embedded in the act of designing. Participants frequently shifted their understanding of the problem based on solution attempts, feedback from tools, and ethical or narrative concerns. These insights extend current visualization design models and highlight the need for frameworks that better account for framing and interpretive judgment. We conclude with implications for visualization research, education, and practice. In particular, we discuss how design education can better support framing and co-evolutionary thinking, and how visualization research can benefit from greater attention to the cognitive strategies and reflective processes that underpin expert design.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul Parsons"},{"affiliation":"Purdue University","email":"shukla37@purdue.edu","name":"Prakash Chandra Shukla"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"parsonsp@purdue.edu","name":"Paul C Parsons"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"930062ee-90b2-4c48-9896-626047d01771","image_caption":"Practitioners such as professional data visualization designers, UX designers, data journalists, and design consultants would find this paper valuable.

However, current VR broadcast systems often lack an effective camera language and do not adequately incorporate dynamic, in-game visualizations, limiting viewer engagement and narrative clarity. To address these limitations, we analyze 400 out-of-play segments from eight major tennis broadcasts to develop a tennis-specific design framework that effectively combines cinematic camera movements with embedded visualizations. We further refine our framework by examining 25 cinematic VR animations, comparing their camera techniques with traditional tennis broadcasts to identify key differences and inform adaptations for VR. Based on data extracted from the broadcast videos, we reconstruct a simulated game that captures the players' and ball's motion and trajectories. Leveraging this design framework and processing pipeline, we develope Beyond the Broadcast, a VR tennis viewing system that integrates embedded visualizations with adaptive camera motions to construct a comprehensive and engaging narrative. Our system dynamically overlays tactical information and key match events onto the simulated environment, enhancing viewer comprehension and narrative engagement while ensuring perceptual immersion and viewing comfort. A user study involving tennis viewers demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional VR broadcasting methods in delivering an immersive, informative viewing experience.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"23110980031@m.fudan.edu.cn","name":"Jielin Feng"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"xinfangtian0206@163.com","name":"Xinfang Tian"},{"affiliation":"University of Nottingham","email":"kai.xu@nottingham.ac.uk","name":"Kai Xu"},{"affiliation":"Al-Farabi Kazakh National University","email":"gulshat.aa@gmail.com","name":"Gulshat Amirkhanova"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"peter650059@hotmail.com","name":"Jun-Hsiang Yao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"d2d68e75-88a1-4f4a-a1c5-7d8cb6706524","image_caption":"Target Practitioners:\nSports Broadcasting Professionals, VR/AR Developers, Sports Data Visualization Specialists. \n\nPractitioners can apply this research to:\nDesign Immersive VR Broadcasts, Optimize Viewer Engagement, Streamline Production Pipelines.","keywords":["Tennis","VR Broadcasting","Embedded Visualization","Camera Motion","Immersive Experience"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1732-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTczMi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.PXNtMYtKHjqSYOYZg3IqeoOVL4fcc3XyzmecM7z0tX8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1732-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=3c55238574155e8b3a922549bef2f925e62f24270015673b2f640056b1ccedf3","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1732-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=15d76c8598b00f373f5900e204f79a2f173d9801009cc7f0b5fb27d184869807","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20006","program_paper_id":"1732","title":"Beyond the Broadcast: Enhancing VR Tennis Broadcasting through Embedded Visualizations and Camera Techniques","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.484194+00:00"},{"abstract":"Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a principled approach to modeling uncertainty in addition to providing predictions, making them particularly valuable for high-stake domains where uncertainty quantification is required.

Second, we present a new stability measure, called bond occurrence rate, associating each bond path present at equilibrium with its rate of occurrence within the input ensemble. We also provide an algorithm, called BondMatcher, for its automatic computation, based on a tailored, geometry-aware partial isomorphism estimation between the extremum graphs of the considered electron densities. Our new stability measure allows for the automatic identification of densities lacking H-bond paths, enabling further visual inspections. Specifically, the topological analysis enabled by our framework corroborates experimental observations and provides refined geometrical criteria for characterizing the disappearance of H-bond paths.

Previous research has relied on either interviewing a limited number of domain users or reviewing relevant application papers in the visualization community, neither of which provides comprehensive insight into visualizations in the wild of a specific domain. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the potential of using Large Language Models (LLM) to analyze visualization usage in domain literature. We use high-dimension (HD) data visualization in sing-cell transcriptomics as a test case, analyzing 1,203 papers that describe 2,056 HD visualizations with highly specialized domain terminologies (e.g., biomarkers, cell lineage). To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a multi-step, human-in-the-loop LLM workflow. Instead of relying solely on LLMs for end-to-end analysis, our workflow enhances analytical quality through 1) integrating image processing and traditional NLP methods to prepare well-structured inputs for three targeted LLM subtasks (i.e., translating domain terminology, summarizing analysis tasks, and performing categorization), and 2) establishing checkpoints for human involvement and validation throughout the process.\nThe analysis results was validated with expert interviews and a test set, revealing three often overlooked aspects in HD visualization: trajectories in HD spaces, inter-cluster relationships, and dimension clustering.\nThis research provides a stepping stone for future studies seeking to use LLMs to bridge the gap between visualization design and domain-specific usage.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"xinyi.liu@utexas.edu","name":"Xinyi Liu"},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"nils@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Nils Gehlenborg"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"32bd145e-06bf-411a-af2e-109192108a7e","image_caption":"Biologists and other domain practitioners new to visualization can use this paper to learn how visualizations are applied in their field and how to create more effective ones.\n\nVisualization designers can use the findings to develop tools that better align with the real-world needs and practices of domain users.","keywords":["High dimensional visualization; LLM-supported literature review; Visualization in the wild"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://hdvis.github.io","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1905-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkwNS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.TswtYR2y7Q1Rq18g6yRk_vbMycBldnYtcwz7XLgUbQQ","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1905-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=664eac2f1add891def02b991197ef9125d9bcbce8e79f4f7739351a7286535a1","preprint_link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/qtsak_v2?view_only=","program_paper_id":"1905","title":"Can LLMs Bridge Domain and Visualization?

These studies often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices and corresponding rationales of the students.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"radu.jianu@city.ac.uk","name":"Radu Jianu"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"a.slingsby@city.ac.uk","name":"Aidan Slingsby"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"j.d.wood@city.ac.uk","name":"Jo Wood"},{"affiliation":"City, University of London","email":"pranava.madhyastha@city.ac.uk","name":"Pranava Madhyastha"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"maeve.hutchinson@city.ac.uk","name":"Maeve Hutchinson"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.388939+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6d474cda-8152-40b9-ba2f-7a28f9bbe0bd","image_caption":"This paper will be of interest to data visualization educators, data scientists, visual analytics researchers, UX designers, and HCI practitioners who engage in or support visualization design.

generate high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion super-resolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations.

With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"snyderl@cs.washington.edu","name":"Luke Snyder"},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","email":"clwang15uw@gmail.com","name":"Chenglong Wang"},{"affiliation":"Microsoft Research","email":"sdrucker@microsoft.com","name":"Steven Drucker"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"snyderl@cs.washington.edu","name":"Luke S.

We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots\u2014between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices\u2014across three different tasks\u2014class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments\u2014to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Oklahoma","email":"quadri@ou.edu","name":"Ghulam Jilani Quadri"},{"affiliation":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","email":"gisellez@ad.unc.edu","name":"Mengyuan Zhu"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"chint@cs.unc.edu","name":"Chin Tseng"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill","email":"danielle.szafir@cs.unc.edu","name":"Danielle Szafir"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zeyuwang@cs.unc.edu","name":"Arran Zeyu Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8aa31c36-374d-4155-b9c3-fd20d8deeec2","image_caption":"Designer, Visualization Psychologist, Empirical Researcher","keywords":["Visualization Perception","Psychology","Subitizing","Fechner\u2019s Law","Dual-System Theory","Categorical Data","Color","Shape"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/y3z2b/?view_only=7f6569187b344fadbd11cc09a6e63d24","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1566-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU2Ni1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.GKAvgeJVw-gUBxJ1l3xCFigzU-0UTuswvm4WeQXv58k","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1566-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=44f139ae5e174fb63110d8f746e8be590e5ea1d8e14929f69ea8dc77cc91d7af","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1566","title":"Characterizing Visualization Perception with Psychological Phenomena: Uncovering the Role of Subitizing in Data Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:15:36.913392+00:00"},{"abstract":"Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.

We tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.7-sonnet, GPT-4.5-preview, and Gemini-2.0-pro) on the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) using standard prompts and our structured approach. The Charts-of-Thought method guides LLMs through a systematic data extraction, verification, and analysis process before answering visualization questions. Our results show Claude-3.7-sonnet achieved a score of 50.17 using this method, far exceeding the human baseline of 28.82. This approach improved performance across all models, with score increases of 21.8% for GPT-4.5, 9.4% for Gemini-2.0, and 13.5% for Claude-3.7 compared to standard prompting. The performance gains were consistent across original and modified VLAT charts, with Claude correctly answering 100% of questions for several chart types that previously challenged LLMs. Our study reveals that modern multimodal LLMs can surpass human performance on visualization literacy tasks when given the proper analytical framework. These findings establish a new benchmark for LLM visualization literacy and demonstrate the importance of structured prompting strategies for complex visual interpretation tasks. Beyond improving LLM visualization literacy, Charts-of-Thought could also enhance the accessibility of visualizations, potentially benefiting individuals with visual impairments or lower visualization literacy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"},{"affiliation":"East West University","email":"md.tarun005@gmail.com","name":"Mohammad Tarun"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amitkumar.das@stonybrook.edu","name":"Amit Kumar Das"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"fcafb37e-70f2-4d68-b9a4-e92902d9d2bd","image_caption":"Type of Practitioners:\nData scientists, AI/ML engineers, visualization researchers, educational technologists, accessibility specialists, business intelligence analysts, and researchers working with multimodal LLMs.\n\nHow they could apply this work:\nData scientists and AI/ML engineers can integrate the Charts-of-Thought prompting technique into their existing LLM workflows to enhance automated chart analysis and data interpretation capabilities significantly, achieving human-level performance on visualization literacy tasks.

In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs\u2014spatiotemporal time series\u2014into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Davis","email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"},{"affiliation":"Scripps Institution of Oceanography","email":"dcayan@ucsd.edu","name":"Daniel Cayan"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"dyuliu@ucdavis.edu","name":"Dongyu Liu"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ykawakami@ucdavis.edu","name":"Yuya Kawakami"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"34e579da-1d6a-4ba7-a6e1-4644a0d2c0b7","image_caption":"Climate scientists in particular would be interested to explore visual methods for analysis alongside often-used statistical methods.

This paper presents a visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests. We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot, which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees, and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the \u201cGlass\u201d dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning dataset, as well as a small user study.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Maastricht University","email":"max.sondag@hotmail.com","name":"Max Sondag"},{"affiliation":"Leipzig University","email":"cmeinecke@informatik.uni-leipzig.de","name":"Christofer Meinecke"},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","email":"d.a.c.collaris@tue.nl","name":"Dennis Collaris"},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne","email":"landesberger@cs.uni-koeln.de","name":"Tatiana von Landesberger"},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","email":"s.j.v.d.elzen@tue.nl","name":"Stef van den Elzen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"max.sondag@hotmail.com","name":"Max Sondag"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"d3492f20-d356-4c55-992d-dbc0fa0fe0af","image_caption":"Modelers from various domains who aim to interpret whether their decision forests.","keywords":["Random Forest","Decision Tree","Tree clustering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/maxie12/RandomForestVis","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1432-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQzMi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDJ9.ifIYYGGEmHRxXCWdYZXNT_KVX8HbJUrUaHH_frPfDsg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1432-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=1989ab35dfaa0512448c07fa180538452eee5fd8de8677e9109ef657ae79e2df","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1432-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=514cea458c3b1733fb19614cabaecf0b0506361929b2dc6b30edbf8b77f27d3b","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22665","program_paper_id":"1432","title":"Cluster-Based Random Forest Visualization and Interpretation","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:12:23.288734+00:00"},{"abstract":"Visualization design study is a widely adopted approach for developing tailored visual solutions to domain-specific problems through close interdisciplinary collaboration. While the visualization community has proposed generalizable frameworks, there is a growing need for domain-aware methodologies that address discipline-specific challenges and refine design study practices. To investigate how domain characteristics and collaborator roles influence the design study process, we conducted interviews with 15 experts, including domain specialists from the humanities, arts, applied sciences, and artificial intelligence, as well as visualization researchers and developers, with direct experience in design studies. Our findings reveal tensions and opportunities that arise from differing expectations, communication styles, and levels of engagement among collaborators at various stages of the design process, including problem formulation, co-design, and evaluation. We highlight how domain-specific norms and role dynamics shape collaboration and influence the trajectory of visualization projects. Based on these insights, we offer practical considerations to help visualization researchers anticipate domain-specific challenges, foster mutual understanding, and adapt their methods accordingly.

Our results show that all three visual variables can be perceived with a medium to high accuracy rate, though performance varies depending on the mobility condition, the visual variable, and even the chart type.

Understanding how LLMs internally represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification \u21d2 Interpretation \u21d2 Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest, interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs, ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM features.

However, effective medical data visualization and exploration pose significant challenges, especially for individuals with limited medical expertise. We introduce a novel XR-based system with two key innovations: (1) a coordinated visualization module integrating Multi-layered Multi-planar Reconstruction with 3D mesh models and (2) a multimodal interaction framework combining hand gestures with LLM-enabled voice commands. We conduct preliminary evaluations, including a 15-participant user study and expert interviews, to demonstrate the system's abilities to enhance spatial understanding and reduce cognitive load.

These misperceptions inflame partisan animosity and may be used to justify extremism among one\u2019s own party. Research suggests that correcting partisan misperceptions\u2014by informing people about the actual views of outparty members\u2014may reduce one\u2019s own expressed support for political extremism, including partisan violence and anti-democratic actions. However, there remains a limited understanding of how the design of correction interventions drives these effects. The present study investigated how correction effects depend on different representations of outparty views communicated through data visualizations. Building on prior interventions that present the average outparty view, we consider the impact of visualizations that more fully convey the range of views among outparty members. We conducted an experiment with U.S.-based participants from Prolific (N=239 Democrats, N=244 Republicans). Participants made predictions about support for political violence and undemocratic practices among members of their political outparty. They were then presented with data from an earlier survey on the actual views of outparty members. Some participants viewed only the average response (Mean-Only condition), while other groups were shown visual representations of the range of views from 75% of the outparty (Mean+Interval condition) or the full distribution of responses (Mean+Points condition). Compared to a control group that was not informed about outparty views, we observed the strongest correction effects (i.e., lower support for political violence and undemocratic practices) among participants in the Mean-only and Mean+Points condition, while correction effects were weaker in the Mean+Interval condition. In addition, participants who observed the full distribution of out-party views (Mean+Points condition) were most accurate at later recalling the degree of support among the outparty. Our findings suggest that data visualizations can be an important tool for correcting pervasive distortions in beliefs about other groups. However, the way in which variability in outparty views is visualized can significantly shape how people interpret and respond to corrective information.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"ssah1@uncc.edu","name":"Subham Sah"},{"affiliation":"Simon Fraser University","email":"akarduni@sfu.ca","name":"Alireza Karduni"},{"affiliation":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte","email":"mrogha@uncc.edu","name":"Milad Rogha"},{"affiliation":"University of Florida","email":"mythai@cise.ufl.edu","name":"My Thai"},{"affiliation":"UNC Charlotte","email":"wdou1@uncc.edu","name":"Wenwen Dou"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dmarkant@uncc.edu","name":"Doug Markant"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ad323fdf-97c1-4e09-a814-a643243d280b","image_caption":"This paper might be of interest to people who broadly work on topics in the social and political sciences, including the use of data visualizations to communicate public opinion on divisive or controversial issues.

The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed improvements using heuristic evaluation. When developing a visual tool or pioneering a novel visualisation approach, identifying areas for enhancement can be challenging. Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation designers and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as studying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages across six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning an indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form initial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using 30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives---user, environment, interface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on synthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next steps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three visualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our longstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it over time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to improvements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020, followed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through 2023; while using it in our teaching each year. This sustained use allows us to reflect on its practical application and offer guidance on how others can incorporate it into their own work.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Bangor University","email":"j.c.roberts@bangor.ac.uk","name":"Jonathan Roberts"},{"affiliation":"Basrah University","email":"hananalnjar@yahoo.com","name":"Hanan Alnjar"},{"affiliation":"Bangor University","email":"aron.e.owen@bangor.ac.uk","name":"Aron Owen"},{"affiliation":"Bangor University","email":"p.ritsos@bangor.ac.uk","name":"Panagiotis Ritsos"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"j.c.roberts@bangor.ac.uk","name":"Professor Jonathan C Roberts"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"70fe9706-bf4e-4d28-a8e4-fc5b25dca854","image_caption":"The Critical Design Strategy (CDS) will be of interest to practitioners who design visualisations, evaluate them, or teach visualisation.

Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet, a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout, enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions. CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of the interaction and association between two such dimensions,\nto refine one of the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","email":"matkovic@vrvis.at","name":"Kresimir Matkovic"},{"affiliation":"VRVis Research Center","email":"splechtna@vrvis.at","name":"Rainer Splechtna"},{"affiliation":"Virginia Tech","email":"gracanin@vt.edu","name":"Denis Gracanin"},{"affiliation":"University of Bergen","email":"helwig.hauser@uib.no","name":"Helwig Hauser"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"matkovic@vrvis.at","name":"Kresimir Matkovic"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c663a254-dd80-4021-88aa-f0840fc3024e","image_caption":"The CrossSet method and the accompanying paper are highly interesting for experts and practitioners working with set-typed data.

Data scientists, developers, and data journalists with programming experience can use weBIGeo to create interactive overlays, enabling both expert and non-expert users to explore large geographic datasets interactively.","keywords":["3D geographic visualization","geographic simulation","WebGPU"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1251-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyNTEtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY5fQ.-bsemwowFvpxhFBOumm8QGM4fxH_ZyDdC4Xmt6bdIR4","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1251-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=69d41271945c29308e6624f01d473f4721a7cb2898deea51c2d64baf701b974b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1251-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=d7d50371eecfca0025fce4b63dbbb7ec9e3b14a05c17dc03737f3ef30e3f36e2","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23364","program_paper_id":"1251","title":"Data-Driven Compute Overlays for Interactive Geographic Simulation and Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:31.507097+00:00"},{"abstract":"Data Humanism is a human-centered design approach that emphasizes the personal, contextual, and imperfect nature of data.

To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"parkjeong02@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jeongin Park"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"dtngus0111@gmail.com","name":"Soohyun Lee"},{"affiliation":"Yonsei University","email":"dhkim16@yonsei.ac.kr","name":"Dae Hyun Kim"},{"affiliation":"Inria-Saclay, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay","email":"sbshin90@cs.umd.edu","name":"Sungbok Shin"},{"affiliation":"Seoul National University","email":"jseo@snu.ac.kr","name":"Jinwook Seo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hj@hcil.snu.ac.kr","name":"Hyeon Jeon"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d30c2f2-5e29-4f5f-a3bc-05c9fb3e4ea0","image_caption":"Domain researchers using dimensionality reduction","keywords":["imensionality reduction","Structural complexity","High-dimensional data","Optimization","Dataset-adaptive workflow"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"We publicized the source code","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1019-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAxOS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjU5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NTl9.UB8ZANe4CoT2L33Oqbu0v70o6cWrP8laaV0jhba2YC8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1019-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=4642d0aac0705abbabc576d7b828b1010e9cb32e0f3e0e22eefd85e15e8ab599","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1019-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=f050de6789071f3f922a793e4d09522a05623112800f9da72109e4f0f1771f8d","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11984","program_paper_id":"1019","title":"Dataset-Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:01:02.061443+00:00"},{"abstract":"Data-driven news articles combine narrative storytelling with data visualizations to inform and influence public opinion on pressing societal issues. These articles often employ persuasive strategies, which are rhetorical techniques in narrative framing, visual rhetoric, or data presentation, to influence audience interpretation and opinion formation regarding information communication. While previous research has examined whether and when data visualizations persuade, the strategic choices made by persuaders remain largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, our work presents a taxonomy of persuasive strategies grounded in psychological theories and expert insights, categorizing 15 strategies across five dimensions: Credibility, Guided Interpretation, Reference-based Framing, Emotional Appeal, and Participation Invitation. To facilitate large-scale analysis, we curated a dataset of 936 data-driven news articles annotated with both persuasive strategies and their perceived effects. Leveraging this corpus, we developed a multimodal, multi-task learning model that jointly predicts the presence of persuasive strategies and their persuasive effects by incorporating both embedded (text and visualization) and explicit (visual narrative and psycholinguistic) features. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in identifying persuasive strategies and measuring their effects.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"chuyizheng02@gmail.com","name":"Chuyi Zheng"},{"affiliation":"Tongji University","email":"ankerlee168@gmail.com","name":"Ziang Li"},{"affiliation":"College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University","email":"shiyang1230@gmail.com","name":"Yang Shi"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"2411927@tongji.edu.cn","name":"Zikai Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9e9a15b7-6ccb-4419-b391-e82e3bd8b907","image_caption":"data scientists, data journalists, journalists, psychologists","keywords":["Data-driven storytelling","persuasive strategies","taxonomy","computational modeling"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1168-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTE2OC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDN9.9dJ0jbSx-SFbEKNdCbH7ueistzrGOHAxo4HYtzhV0t8","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1168-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5b6f18e88212b573327bd40ab857adc092feb5dc5f982533aa47b0781ff3de82","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1168-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=edeab3ea6ef870e8b3a571d92d489ac90ec554bb8fa71fb84ae2a0bdf814da78","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1168","title":"Data Speaks, But Who Gives It a Voice?

We contextualize these beliefs through a genealogical analysis, which brings deconstruction theory into practice by providing a historic backdrop for these opposing perspectives.

While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"bli303@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Boyan LI"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"syan195@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"siyu yan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yuyuluo@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Yuyu Luo"},{"affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"weikaiyang@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Weikai Yang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhihaoshuai@hkust-gz.edu.cn","name":"Zhihao Shuai"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f4073f80-c0bd-4d83-9c72-3dcfd060ef7f","image_caption":"Data scientists can use the transparent reasoning as interactive tutorials, showing junior analysts how ambiguous questions are broken down into formal specifications.","keywords":["Data visualization","automatic visualization","large language models"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Bvivib-shuai/DeepVIS","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1818-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTgxOC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.FXCLwdZIclGXTMVWCwenvCot0Ed0G7ZmeUnu46zcPAo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1818-cam-i10.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=0a9c599b66fde5b4b40fcf1ca003268269c7208cc64ef7c1b7b9cd3aa333a430","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1818-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=35ce7375f29d1ca4fd8d429d7afef60a9e50eef97ee29a5d82bb4162c4cb5fe8","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01700","program_paper_id":"1818","title":"DeepVIS: Bridging Natural Language and Data Visualization Through Step-wise Reasoning","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:21.106871+00:00"},{"abstract":"Visualizing data often entails data transformations that can reveal and hide information, operations we dub disclosure tactics. Whether designers hide information intentionally or as an implicit consequence of other design choices, tools and frameworks for visualization offer little explicit guidance on disclosure. To systematically characterize how visualizations can limit access to an underlying dataset, we contribute a content analysis of 425 examples of visualization techniques sampled from academic papers in the visualization literature, resulting in a taxonomy of disclosure tactics. Our taxonomy organizes disclosure tactics based on how they change the data representation underlying a chart, providing a systematic way to reason about design trade-offs in terms of what information is revealed, distorted, or hidden. We demonstrate the benefits of using our taxonomy by showing how it can guide reasoning in design scenarios where disclosure is a first-order consideration.

While prior visualization research has explored data and task abstractions for genomics, the design space for depicting these three-dimensional (3D) genome models---and associated genome-mapped data---remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the visualization of genomic data with a spatial component. First, we systematically survey how 3D genome models are used and depicted in computational biology. We analyze over 300 papers with figures that visualize 3D genomic data and categorize the methods for visual representation. From this survey, we derive a design space for visualizing 3D genome data, identifying common patterns and key properties such as representation, visual channels, and composition. We position these findings within an existing genomics visualization taxonomy, refining and extending existing classifications. Second, we augment Gosling, a declarative visualization grammar for genomics, to support 3D genomic data. Our integration enables expressive authoring of visualizations that connect traditional genome-mapped information with 3D genome models, emphasizing their spatial characteristics. To demonstrate its utility, we employ our extended grammar to recreate interactive examples, showcasing its ability to represent complex visual designs.

The intricate nature of high-dimensional features necessitates dimensionality reduction (DR) methods to explore alignment of multimodal embeddings. However, existing DR methods fail to account for cross-modal alignment metrics, resulting in severe occlusion of points with divergent metrics clustered together, inaccurate contour maps from over-aggregation, and insufficient support for multi-scale exploration. To address these problems, this paper introduces DKMap, a novel DR visualization technique for interactive exploration of multimodal embeddings through Dynamic Kernel enhanced projection. First, rather than performing dimensionality reduction and contour estimation sequentially, we introduce a kernel regression supervised t-SNE that directly integrates post-projection contour mapping into the projection learning process, ensuring cross-modal alignment mapping accuracy. Second, to enable multi-scale exploration with dynamic zooming and progressively enhanced local detail, we integrate validation-constrained \u03b1 refinement of a generalized t-kernel with quad-tree-based multi-resolution technique, ensuring reliable kernel parameter tuning without overfitting. DKMap is implemented as a multi-platform visualization tool, featuring a web-based system for interactive exploration and a Python package for computational notebook analysis. Quantitative comparisons with baseline DR techniques demonstrate DKMap\u2019s superiority in accurately mapping cross-modal alignment metrics. We further demonstrate generalizability and scalability of DKMap with three usage scenarios, including visualizing million-scale text-to-image corpus, comparatively evaluating generative models, and exploring a billion-scale pretraining dataset.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"chenxiruan64@gmail.com","name":"Chenxi Ruan"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)","email":"zengwei81@gmail.com","name":"Wei Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yyebd@connect.ust.hk","name":"Yilin Ye"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d649242-7596-4300-84fe-793b6a69b69c","image_caption":"data scientists","keywords":["Kernel Regression","Vision-language Alignment","Multimodal Embeddings","Interactive Exploration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/HKUST-CIVAL/DKMap","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1781-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc4MS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.mIEkuipp1uuDChYcICrqdgZPNtoFBcSMQvvq4GqkYzw","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1781-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=8b80075555ac6b7f1a5dab2e1c9cedde3c9833d48c6eb791fa9107fb33c6469f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1781-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=5dd345267bdc364a9bdb91019245288c4b0273910c211bc7e71726c56ac84b55","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1781","title":"DKMap: Interactive Exploration of Vision-Language Alignment in Multimodal Embeddings via Dynamic Kernel Enhanced Projection","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:21.209376+00:00"},{"abstract":"Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI systems?

Our results suggest that visualization may have a significant role to play in AI-enabled data analysis workflows. As AI tools become increasingly ubiquitous and sometimes autonomous, anyone interested in getting the most out of them might be curious about the importance of visual input in facilitating model data understanding. \n\nIndeed, we hope the visualization community, including scientists, designers, and developers, take interest in visualization for AI as a new and impactful design space. Our research, while preliminary, may lead to practical changes in the ways we present quantitative information to AI models across knowledge domains.\n\nPractitioners, especially when conducting exploratory data analysis, could take away trying both scenarios: (1) inputting full datasets into a model (even a couple hundred points) with a simple visualization, and (2) just the visualization itself as a starting point to understand salient dataset characteristics. Both scenarios may result in helpful analysis, but our results suggest the first may include convenient statistical data analysis, and the second a concise summary of standout features. This quick, accessible workflow could help any data analyst collaborate more effectively with AI systems.\n\nPractitioners would also learn how easily AIs may be silently tripped up by inconsistent data and visualization inputs. They might begin exercising more caution when conducting exploratory data and visual analysis with an AI, which may not realize or mention potential discrepancies in its inputs.\n\nFinally, practitioners may also be excited about how visualization design may evolve in the future. If the VIS community builds on our work to design charts or graphs that more effectively elicit insights from models, AI-enabled workflows could become more powerful and efficient, allowing humans and AI to jointly tackle more complex empirical questions. Overall, our results lay groundwork for both immediate and future implications for practitioners in a world with increasingly powerful AI systems.","keywords":["AI","Workflow Design","Human-Machine Analysis."],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/johnathansun/lvlm-vis-data-understanding","open_access_supplemental_question":"Our source code is thoroughly documented, and we provide original, full datasets on Github for end-to-end verification and reproducibility.

Our proposed approach enables the exploration and analysis of the disruptions' spatial and temporal patterns and delay accumulation to identify vulnerable segments in the railroad network. We assess the effectiveness of our approach through an expert interview highlighting how the accumulation of delays and disruptions is lucidly communicated and provides valuable insights into their spread across the network. We discuss the outcomes of the expert interview alongside the limitations we identified and how we resolve these. Finally, we illustrate directions for future work, including online data to assist railroad planners with real-time monitoring for proactive decision-making and improved operations.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology","email":"sandhya.rajendran@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Sandhya Rajendran"},{"affiliation":"Eindhoven University of Technology","email":"a.arleo@tue.nl","name":"Alessio Arleo"},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne","email":"landesberger@cs.uni-koeln.de","name":"Tatiana von Landesberger"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology","email":"miksch@ifs.tuwien.ac.at","name":"Silvia Miksch"},{"affiliation":"University of Cologne","email":"max.sondag93@gmail.com","name":"Max Sondag"},{"affiliation":"TU Wien","email":"michaela.tuscher@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Michaela Tuscher"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology","email":"velitchko.filipov@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Velitchko Filipov"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sandhya.rajendran@tuwien.ac.at","name":"Sandhya Rajendran"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:16.839835+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"266aaadd-b874-4660-9061-3746f4ce4747","image_caption":"Transportation planners and analysts, Urban informatics or smart city researchers","keywords":["Spatio-temporal Data","Networks"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/d2fzh/?view_only=2715e41e0e6c4e23812ec2465f4da48e","open_access_supplemental_question":"thoroughly documented source code, particularly substantial supplemental material","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1171-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExNzEtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM5fQ.L367LDHBv2ARczZp_rIt4s8cy0koKlV36RAYE21RSdA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1171-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=ba1fee4d09bfa3decf9581b99ae7ac8b8ed55744e584657ffea8c1a8c2414dad","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1171-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=263962285252478c6187400b061038f77cc5db3071e8acaebaaefd67cb4d6a2a","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1171","title":"Don't Stop Me Now: Visualizing Disruptions in Railroad Networks","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:39:00.342206+00:00"},{"abstract":"We present \u201cDrawing in the Flow\u201d, a mixed-reality 3D user interface for authoring illustrative, multivariate 3D flow visualizations by sketching on, or better stated, in, 3D data.

Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the gap between users\u2019 intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured Speech Input Uncertainty for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how uncertain users\u2019 speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data analysis tasks, phases, and Embodiment Reliance driven by the counts and types of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"mjohns28@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Matthew Johnson"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"visual.tycho@gmail.com","name":"Kirsten Whitley"},{"affiliation":"Department of Defense","email":"ericpkrokos@gmail.com","name":"Eric Krokos"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"varshney@cs.umd.edu","name":"Amitabh Varshney"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hsong02@cs.umd.edu","name":"Hyemi Song"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"33454738-a9a9-4944-a27f-262d1da9f35d","image_caption":"Researchers, Developers, Designers","keywords":["Embodiment","Natural Language Interaction (NLI)","Immersive Analytics","Speech Patterns","Semantic Entropy","User Intent","Speech Acts"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/sv4fn/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1747-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc0Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.s6fGM-5lFn9V8DO92XOoqD2bkIUDHuwi4Kye9nwCHXg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1747-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=93898a1dc269b9ecfce08c6aea960807d3aa4359eac17266104a8cc0b1714b79","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1747-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=291f8a6246b2504fe3e40fb8e7f1113944d169024258ba7cdafe402d6db88e62","preprint_link":"Link (arXiv) will be updated upon release before the conference.","program_paper_id":"1747","title":"Embodied Natural Language Interaction (NLI): Speech Input Patterns in Immersive Analytics","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.683954+00:00"},{"abstract":"In-vitro fertilization (IVF) has become standard practice to address infertility, which affects more than one in ten couples in the US. However, current protocols yield relatively low success rates of about 20% per treatment cycle. A critical but complex and time-consuming step is the grading and selection of embryos for implantation. Although incubators with time-lapse microscopy have enabled computational analysis of embryo development, existing automated approaches either require extensive manual annotations or use opaque deep learning models that are hard for clinicians to validate and trust. We present EmbryoProfiler, a visual analytics system collaboratively developed with embryologists, biologists, and machine learning researchers to support clinicians in visually assessing embryo viability from time-lapse microscopy imagery. Our system incorporates a deep learning pipeline that automatically annotates microscopy images and extracts clinically interpretable features relevant for embryo grading. Our contributions include: (1) a semi-automatic, visualization-based workflow that guides clinicians through fertilization assessment, developmental timing evaluation, morphological inspection, and comparative analysis of embryos; (2) innovative interactive visualizations, such as cell-shape plots, designed to facilitate efficient analysis of morphological and developmental characteristics; and (3) an integrated, explainable machine learning classifier offering transparent, clinically-informed embryo viability scoring to predict live birth outcomes.

We introduce ENCQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. ENCQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs.

We conducted a comparative classroom study with 68 students, using pre- and post-tests, worksheet activities, and group discussions to assess learning outcomes and understanding. Our results show statistically significant improvement in students\u2019 understanding of stacked area charts and streamgraphs, while no significant differences between the learning materials were found. This suggests that more factors than initially anticipated \u2013 such as engagement, motivation and active learning strategies \u2013 influence the learning outcome. The analysis of the worksheets revealed that while students could infer surface-level insights from charts, over 70% struggled to identify underlying patterns or relationships. Additionally, a common challenge across all learning materials was reading fatigue, which often led students to skim content, disengage, or misinterpret key information. These findings highlight the need for educational tools and approaches that foster deeper understanding of unfamiliar visualizations, reduce cognitive load, and encourage active engagement.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"St. P\u00f6lten University of Applied Sciences","email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"makej@mail.muni.cz","name":"Magdalena Kejstova"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"christina.stoiber@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Christina Stoiber"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"martin.kandlhofer@ocg.at","name":"Martin Kandlhofer"},{"affiliation":"Austrian Computer Society","email":"leniproduction@gmail.com","name":"Alena Boucher"},{"affiliation":"Masaryk University","email":"simone.kriglstein@univie.ac.at","name":"Simone Kriglstein"},{"affiliation":"Erich Fried Realgymnasium","email":"shelley.buchinger@brg9.at","name":"Shelley Buchinger"},{"affiliation":"St. Poelten University of Applied Sciences","email":"wolfgang.aigner@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Wolfgang Aigner"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"magdalena.boucher@fhstp.ac.at","name":"Magdalena Boucher"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"851f1b42-91da-4dcc-a08e-c6d8e564d251","image_caption":"Our findings are relevant for visualization educators and designers of learning materials  as they shed light on visualization literacy and student preferences in middle- and high schools.","keywords":["visualization education","schools","learning materials","visualization literacy"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://phaidra.fhstp.ac.at/detail/o:7304","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1863-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTg2My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.LE5fAigXM1klY3wa3np7PG18Pbf1sPWARgNIUeVhadQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1863-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a2d0693c560289747b782fd5cdd317323ff3e033a970b0882c5919e59e9f7f37","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1863-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=2ff5beeeaac7205e3ed60585bcb0c01566d63af44edc251deef002d71e006087","preprint_link":"https://phaidra.fhstp.ac.at/detail/o:7302","program_paper_id":"1863","title":"Enhancing Data Visualization Literacy: A Comparative Study of Learning Materials in Schools","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:21.298138+00:00"},{"abstract":"As AI systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, enabling users to accurately interpret model behavior is critical.

Visual Graph Querying (VGQ) streamlines this process by enabling users to construct and execute queries via an interactive interface without resorting to complex coding. However, current VGQ tools only allow users to construct simple and specific query graphs, limiting users' ability to interactively express their query intent, especially for underspecified query intent. To address these limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying system to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by supporting intuitive graph structure construction and flexible parameterized rule specification. Specifically, Envisage comprises four stages: Query Expression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through intuitive operations; Query Verification enables the validation of constructed queries via rule verification and query instantiation; Progressive Query Execution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying results; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation. To evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 graph analysts. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in constructing, verifying, and executing complex graph queries.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"qishuang.fu@monash.edu","name":"Qishuang Fu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"shuangyu001@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Shuangyue Han"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yguo017@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yichen Guo"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"joseph.liu@monash.edu","name":"Joseph Liu"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.670872+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ae49090b-23a7-453b-8d5d-eb0ad8893a08","image_caption":"Graph analyst, visualization researcher\n\nThey can use our tool to conduct the graph querying and learn the interaction design of our tools.","keywords":["Visual graph querying","interactive query construction","graph data"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Selvalim/VGQ-front","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1567-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTU2Ny1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.rzuAUMg7XFNjDDwlsThoiJeFQZcTeIM3-7COVL_v98I","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1567-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=8b95007e89296ce15299d5427c6c296f48924d1b2a1d942f66ee272ec3739077","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1567-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=53026865ca93e2a75a4d9299a4664a79f11139f1e49113ad07ba6f7957cf0181","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11999","program_paper_id":"1567","title":"Envisage: Towards Expressive Visual Graph Querying","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:15:37.351054+00:00"},{"abstract":"In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in distributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual displays.

In this setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial\nscales.

Visual analytics combines computational techniques with interactive visualizations, enabling the identification of patterns, anomalies, and attribute interactions.

We introduce EventBox, a novel data representation and visual encoding approach for analyzing groups of events and their multivariate attributes. We have integrated EventBox into Sequen-C, a visual analytics system for the analysis of event sequences. To enable the agile creation of EventBoxes in Sequen-C, we have added user-driven transformations, including alignment, sorting, substitution and aggregation. To enhance analytical depth, we incorporate automatically generated statistical analyses, providing additional insight into the significance of attribute interactions. We evaluated our approach involving 21 participants (3 domain experts, 18 novice data analysts). We used the ICE-T framework to assess visualization value, user performance metrics completing a series of tasks, and interactive sessions with domain experts. We also present three case studies with real-world healthcare data demonstrating how EventBox and its integration into Sequen-C reveal meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights. These results demonstrate that our work advances visual analytics by providing a flexible solution for exploring temporal and multivariate attributes in event sequences.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"l.montanagonzalez@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Luis Montana Gonzalez"},{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"jgmagallanescastaneda1@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Jessica Magallanes"},{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"m.juarez@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Miguel A Juarez"},{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"s.mason@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Suzanne Mason"},{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"a.j.narracott@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Andrew Narracott"},{"affiliation":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust","email":"lindsey.vangemeren@nhs.net","name":"Lindsey van Gemeren"},{"affiliation":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust","email":"steven.wood8@nhs.net","name":"Steven Wood"},{"affiliation":"University of Sheffield","email":"m.villa-uriol@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Maria-Cruz Villa-Uriol"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"l.montanagonzalez@sheffield.ac.uk","name":"Luis Rene Montana Gonzalez"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"29b8a92c-ef97-44df-b315-a903fe54fa53","image_caption":"Data scientists and visual analytics experts interested in studying or developing new techniques to analyze multivariate temporal event sequences that can be extracted from event logs.

Standards like the WCAG2 contrast ratio are intended to guide designers toward accessible color use but are increasingly misapplied as oversimplified and misunderstood shortcuts for achieving perceptual accessibility. This misuse highlights the need for more nuanced, perceptually grounded evaluation tools. In response, we present our Modular Accessible Perceptibility (MAP) contrast model and tool, which integrates advanced color appearance models to assess perceptibility and flag risks associated with simultaneous contrast. By augmenting the CAM16-UCS model with a CAM16 CCz simultaneous chromatic contrast calculation, our model can isolate and measure the predicted shift resulting from simultaneous contrast along the chroma axis. This enables a more refined evaluation of visual contrast that better reflects the complexities of human color perception. Additionally, our tool performs modularly segmented automated checks to assign MAP contrast index scores, offering a holistic assessment of a map\u2019s visual accessibility. This paper details the development and validation of the MAP model and tool, underscoring accessibility and inclusive design as fundamental rights, and demonstrating their utility in advancing perceptual accessibility in geovisualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","email":"limpisathian@wisc.edu","name":"P.

Image complexity metrics showed no correlation with human-perceived visualization complexity. Manual feature coding produced a reasonable predictive model but required substantial effort.

When these characters belong to different groups, a new research question emerges: how can we balance optimization of readability across the groups while preserving the overall narrative structure of the story? Traditional algorithms that optimize global readability metrics (like minimizing crossings) can introduce quality biases between the different groups based on their cardinality and other aspects of the data. Visual consequences of these biases are: making characters of minority groups disproportionately harder to follow, and visually deprioritizing important characters when their curves become entangled with numerous secondary characters. We present F2Stories, a modular framework that addresses these challenges in storylines by offering three complementary optimization modes: (1) fairnessMode ensures that no group bears a disproportionate burden of visualization complexity regardless of their representation in the story; (2) focusMode allows prioritizing a group of characters while maintaining good readability for secondary characters; and (3) standardMode globally optimizes classical aesthetic metrics. Our approach is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), offering optimality guarantees, precise balancing of competing metrics through weighted objectives, and the flexibility to incorporate complex fairness concepts as additional constraints without the need to redesign the entire algorithm. We conducted an extensive experimental analysis to demonstrate how F2Stories enables more fair or focus group-prioritized storyline visualizations while maintaining adherence to established layout constraints. Our evaluation includes comprehensive results from a detailed case study that shows the effectiveness of our approach in real-world narrative contexts.

However, existing edge bundling methods often have high computational complexity, leading to scalability issues. This paper presents a new framework for fast edge bundling and faithfulness metrics for large and complex graphs using spectral sparsification, which sparsifies a graph G into a subgraph G' with O(nlogn) edges, preserving the spectrum of G. We first present a general framework, FEB (Fast Edge Bundling), utilizing spectral sparsification to improve the efficiency of existing bundling methods while maintaining a similar quality of bundling. We then present the FBQ (Fast Bundling Quality) framework for proxy bundle faithfulness metrics, to measure how FEB faithfully preserves the ground truth structure in the original edge bundling, with two variants, FBQ_JS (utilizing Jaccard Similarity) and  FBQ_SQ (utilizing sampling quality metrics). Extensive experiments using various real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency of the FEB framework, with 61% runtime improvement over the original edge bundling methods without sparsification, while maintaining a similar quality by FBQ quality metrics and visual comparison.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xjia9238@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xingjue Jiang"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"amei2916@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Amyra Meidiana"},{"affiliation":"University of Sydney","email":"xzen6984@uni.sydney.edu.au","name":"Xianyuan Zeng"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"seokhee.hong@sydney.edu.au","name":"Seok-Hee Hong"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.278826+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"333107f7-56b6-4215-823a-2550e2a1c1e1","image_caption":"Data scientists, System biologists, and Sociologists using large and complex networks.\n\nThey can use the new framework for fast edge bundling to produce a faithful visualization of large and complex graphs, with fast runtime.","keywords":["Edge bundling","Spectral sparsification","Faithfulness metrics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1132-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMzItZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTk0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTQ0fQ.iMwWAsU1tVLAgTSM-ZtG889XudxsHjD5YGSB9HwwqeU","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1132-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=8941403ff7eae2b1b83b5c1ff12a72e8999e59a2325db4e633f1ce55e84355dd","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1132","title":"Fast and Faithful Edge Bundling for Large and Complex Networks","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:39:04.568146+00:00"},{"abstract":"Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"dlenz@anl.gov","name":"David Lenz"},{"affiliation":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","email":"hfyu@unl.edu","name":"Hongfeng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Argonne National Laboratory","email":"tpeterka@mcs.anl.gov","name":"Tom Peterka"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sunjianxin66@gmail.com","name":"Jianxin Sun"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"72737da9-0932-41f6-99a2-803817cf8c15","image_caption":"Scientists in scientific simulation, data scientists, practitioners in data visualization.\n\nThe practitioners can apply the proposed method to reduce the training time of modeling large-scale, complex, and high-dimensional data into an implicit neural representation.","keywords":["Time-varying volume","volume visualization","input encoding","deep learning"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1455-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTQ1NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzUwLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNTB9.rqoQ6nd-0Bc9lkPXVIekY_JsKNxXzKyT0k9nuz70yYM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1455-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=99e7103edd00dd5dc0102a6bdb64ca0e9256f5561dbfd68f1b758bb531493226","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1455-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a98d9b8e0d7c190ec6567cbc1dfb4968b74b68b3f8231b8369a1e2b6e067b3f0","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03836","program_paper_id":"1455","title":"F-Hash: Feature-Based Hash Design for Time-Varying Volume Visualization via Multi-Resolution Tesseract Encoding","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:12:30.888221+00:00"},{"abstract":"We introduce FlexPhys, a cookbook that researchers can use to operationalize data physicalization research questions through workshop design.

We draw from our experience designing data physicalization workshops and from reviewing three existing workshops, to distill the cookbook's core ingredient (context and goal) and eight additional ingredients related to making (material, tool, technique), data encoding (data type, variable, mark/unit), and interactivity (interaction, sensory modality).

However, designing optimal workflows remains challenging due to the expansive design space. Current practices rely heavily on practitioner intuition and expertise, often resulting in design fixation or an unstructured trial-and-error exploration. To address these challenges, this work introduces FlowForge, an interactive visualization tool to facilitate multi-agent workflow creation through i) a structured visual explore of the design space and ii) in-situ guidance based on design patterns. Based on formative studies and literature review, FlowForge organizes the workflow design process into three levels (i.e., task planning, agent assignment, and agent optimization), ranging from abstract to concrete. A structured visual exploration of the design space enable users to transition from high-level concepts to detailed implementations, and to compare alternative solutions across multiple performance metrics. Additionally, drawing from established workflow design patterns, FlowForge provides contextually relevant in-situ suggestions at each level as users navigate the design space. Use cases and expert interviews demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of FlowForge, while also yielding valuable observations into how practitioners explore the design space and leverage guidance in workflow creation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"panzhan1hao@gmail.com","name":"Pan Hao"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"dongyeop@umn.edu","name":"Dongyeop Kang"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","email":"hinds084@umn.edu","name":"Nicholas Hinds"},{"affiliation":"University of Minnesota","email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"qianwen@umn.edu","name":"Qianwen Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ed3195e2-8726-4d85-acb7-c5ed2dc361bb","image_caption":"AI practitioners interested in designing multi-agent workflows can use this paper to learn how to systematically explore the workflow design space and apply structured guidance to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their workflow creation process.","keywords":["LLM workflows","Multi-agent Workflows","design space","hierarchical visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/Visual-Intelligence-UMN/FlowForge","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1729-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTcyOS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.y3ksqVhoQI55jk6aNOhgKdYcw58xju9yyeQod7Vpc_Q","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1729-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=545c889242894177b4a09a8a6af3c3c58e31a314439d36982b594a8fd46186d3","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15559","program_paper_id":"1729","title":"FlowForge: Guiding the Creation of Multi-agent Workflows with Interactive Visualizations as a Thinking Scaffold","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.443324+00:00"},{"abstract":"Visualization design influences how people perceive data patterns, yet most research focuses on low-level analytic tasks, such as finding correlations.

Computing and storing connectivity information is a major bottleneck for visualization algorithms, affecting both time and memory performance. Recent task-parallel data structures address this by precomputing connectivity information at runtime while the analysis algorithm executes, effectively hiding computation costs and improving performance. However, existing approaches are CPU-bound, forcing the data structure and analysis algorithm to compete for the same computational resources, limiting potential speedups. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel task-parallel approach optimized for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. Specifically, we offload the computation of mesh connectivity information to GPU threads, enabling CPU threads to focus on executing the visualization algorithm.

We observed that it often produces unstable results where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic elements\u2014specifically, initial projection positions and negative sampling\u2014impact UMAP results, we introduce \u201cghosts\u201d, or duplicates of data points representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a data point\u2019s projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our framework.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"},{"affiliation":"Link\u00f6ping University","email":"tfujiwara@ucdavis.edu","name":"Takanori Fujiwara"},{"affiliation":"Sungkyunkwan University","email":"jmjo@skku.edu","name":"Jaemin Jo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"mw.jung@skku.edu","name":"Myeongwon Jung"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"28a61ed9-3f15-4835-a688-e72b1fd6fa0c","image_caption":"Practitioners who work with high-dimensional data and use dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and biologists, would be particularly interested in this paper.

However, position encodings can be susceptible to systematic biases depending on the intrinsic properties of the visualized data, such as its shape and cognitive processes of memory and perception. Using line charts as a case study, we investigate how the shape of data, such as local and global extrema, can bias the perception and recall of average data values. In two studies, participants estimated the average data values in a line chart by adjusting a slider with their mouse. We found that participants\u2019 estimates were systematically biased toward the direction of the global extremum. When multiple salient extrema were present, estimates appeared influenced by several extrema simultaneously but ultimately leaned toward the global extremum. \nNotably, the strength of this bias varied depending on whether participants were perceiving or recalling the mean. This work advances our understanding of how extrema influence perception and memory, potentially exaggerating or underestimating critical trends and contributing to a skewed interpretation of data.

The GoG helped expand the expressive gamut of visualization by moving beyond fixed chart types and towards a design space of composable operators. Yet, the resultant design space has surprising limitations, inconsistencies, and cliffs---even seemingly simple charts like mosaics, waffles, and ribbons fall out of scope of most GoG implementations. To author such charts, visualization designers must either rely on overburdened grammar developers to implement purpose-built mark types (thus reintroducing the issues of typologies) or drop to lower-level frameworks. In response, we present GoFish: a declarative visualization grammar that formalizes Gestalt principles (e.g., uniform spacing, containment, and connection) that have heretofore been complected in GoG constructs. These graphical operators achieve greater expressive power than their predecessors by enabling recursive composition: they can be nested and overlapped arbitrarily. Through a diverse example gallery, we demonstrate how graphical operators free users to arrange shapes in many different ways while retaining the benefits of high-level grammars like scale resolution and coordinate transform management. Recursive composition naturally yields an infinite design space that blurs the boundary between an expressive, low-level grammar and a concise, high-level one. In doing so, we point towards an updated theory of visualization, one that is open to an innumerable space of graphic representations instead of limited to a fixed set of good designs.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"jopo@mit.edu","name":"Josh Pollock"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jopo@mit.edu","name":"Josh M.

This is particularly important for those at higher health risks and their care providers, allowing for better risk interpretation which may lead to more informed decisions. However, the kinds of visualizations used to represent data may impart biases that influence data interpretation and decision making. Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone.

This paper presents a novel approach that generates cohesive and natural illustrations of vertical bar charts by integrating real-world object images as visual embellishments. The proposed pipeline takes an object image and a reference bar chart as input and produces an embellished bar chart that follows the structure of the input chart. To preserve chart integrity by maintaining the count, position, size, and order of data values, we introduce a strategy that anchors the top and bottom parts of the object image to the top and bottom of each bar while allowing the middle section to be filled by the generation model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the pipeline through the generation of 4,725 chart images followed by evaluation based on three integrity metrics. The results show that generation success rate is affected by various factors. Finally, we discuss future directions for generalization and better usability of our pipeline, and limitations of evaluation used in our approach.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"KAIST","email":"ksg_0320@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Seon Gyeom Kim"},{"affiliation":"KAIST","email":"jaeyoungchoi@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Jae Young Choi"},{"affiliation":"KAIST","email":"phillip0701@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Yuseung Lee"},{"affiliation":"KAIST","email":"jhyun513@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Jaeryung Chung"},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"ryrossi@adobe.com","name":"Ryan Rossi"},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"jkil@adobe.com","name":"Jihyung Kil"},{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"eunyee@adobe.com","name":"Eunyee Koh"},{"affiliation":"KAIST","email":"takyeonlee@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Tak Yeon Lee"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ksg_0320@kaist.ac.kr","name":"Seon Gyeom Kim"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:16.839835+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"2a0c8e77-b8b1-4b7d-ab16-0034e10e1dee","image_caption":"Data journalists\nData Visualization and Graphic Designers\nData Vis Researchers\nComputer Vision(GenAI, T2I Model) Researchers and Practitioners","keywords":["Chart Embellishment","Grounded Image Generation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://groundedchartgeneration.github.io/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1326-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzMjYtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTcxfQ.dKkqADEL3Rf1IAiPaCctsSmGmzYEOx1YlnCV2IWpBEs","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1326-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=5dc7c0ea4ba9fa06fc8ff3437eeff399221097182e555c9b8cb852da9922bad0","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1326","title":"Grounded Generation of Embellished Bar Chart Ensuring Chart Integrity","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:31.805704+00:00"},{"abstract":"Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"UC Davis","email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"},{"affiliation":"NVIDIA","email":"qiwu@nvidia.com","name":"Qi Wu"},{"affiliation":"University of Groningen","email":"h.gadirov@rug.nl","name":"Hamid Gadirov"},{"affiliation":"University of California at Davis","email":"ma@cs.ucdavis.edu","name":"Kwan-Liu Ma"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"david.bauer009@gmail.com","name":"David Bauer"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"99d47ba0-22e8-4d68-9484-346e6fc722b8","image_caption":"This work would be interesting to simulation scientists, scientific rendering specialists, and computer graphics researchers.\n\nThe technique could support practitioners in creating more performant, higher-quality rendering systems using the presented radiance cache.","keywords":["Radiance caching","path tracing","volume rendering","gaussian splatting"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1100-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTEwMC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.2y2bNyzkMX52ICLA9Nccye_l0c9TRfdzSwdhlNMu2zg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1100-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=6b96d726f238484d999aed99c74488e201abf96aed57b67559f340d796fdda04","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1100-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=ac33b7381109e73467d94b09c4b1acdec992e568936446a3e88d11d7d32e4474","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19718","program_paper_id":"1100","title":"GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D Gaussian Splatting","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:02:24.978176+00:00"},{"abstract":"Data-driven decision making has become a popular practice in science, industry, and public policy.

However, the design of journalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance multiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience\u2019s expected data literacy, tight publication deadlines, and the team\u2019s technical skills. Data journalists often come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and data science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While previous studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process employed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific research questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do editorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we collected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news articles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result, we created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both properties describing the articles\u2019 aspects and the visual/interactive features of maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured interviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily. Through these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made by editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected the practitioners\u2019 feedback on our design space to externally validate it. With these results, we aim to provide researchers and journalists with empirical data to design and study journalistic maps.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"emilly.brito@ufpe.br","name":"Emilly Brito"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"gusto@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Luiz Morais"},{"affiliation":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco","email":"nivan@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Nivan Ferreira"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"agsn@cin.ufpe.br","name":"Arlindo Gomes"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6c986f26-eabe-4109-b6ab-7ba4c489451d","image_caption":"Maps are crucial tools that data journalists use to tell stories with spatial data; the design space can help with the conceptualization of new maps and in the classification of map production within the newsroom.

However, few projects examine how users organize their own visualization programs and how their coding choices may deviate from the intents of toolkit developers, impacting visualization prototyping and design. Further, is it possible to infer users\u2019 reasoning indirectly through their code, even when users copy code from other sources? We explore this question through a qualitative analysis of 715 D3 programs on Observable. We identify three levels of program organization based on how users decompose their code into smaller blocks: Program-, Chart-, and Component-Level code decomposition, with a strong preference for Component-Level reasoning. In a series of interviews, we corroborate that these levels reflect how Observable users reason about visualization programs. We compare common user-made components with those theorized in the Grammar of Graphics to assess overlap in user and toolkit developer reasoning. We find that, while the Grammar of Graphics covers basic visualizations well, it falls short in describing complex visualization types, especially those with animation, interaction, and parameterization components. Our findings highlight how user practices differ from formal grammars and reinforce ongoing efforts to rethink visualization toolkit support, including augmenting learning tools and AI assistants to better reflect real-world coding strategies.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"lin.family.folders@gmail.com","name":"Melissa Lin"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"mlamkin@cs.washington.edu","name":"Medina Lamkin"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hbako@virginia.edu","name":"Hannah Bako"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"leibatt@cs.washington.edu","name":"Leilani Battle"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"heerpate@cs.washington.edu","name":"Heer Patel"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a4b21717-3ef3-4fdf-b25a-30b41b9f0ef9","image_caption":"Practitioners who use D3 or plan to use D3 might benefit from this work.

While traditional hypothesis-driven research has proven effective, it is constrained by human cognitive limitations, the complexity of biological systems, and the high costs associated with trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated scientific progress. However, the sheer volume of predictions they generate makes manual selection for experimental validation impractical. Attempts to leverage large language models (LLMs) for filtering predictions and generating novel hypotheses have been impeded by issues such as hallucinations and the lack of structured knowledge grounding, which undermine their reliability. To address these challenges, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance scientific discovery and validation visually. HypoChainer operates through three key stages: (1) Exploration and Contextualization: Domain experts employ retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract insights and research entry points from vast GNN predictions, supplemented by interactive explanations for in-depth understanding; (2) Hypothesis Chain Formation: Experts iteratively explore the relationships between KG information relevant to the predictions and semantically linked nodes consistent with the hypothesis, gaining knowledge and insights while refining the hypothesis through suggestions from LLMs and KGs; and (3) Validation Prioritization: Predictions are filtered and prioritized based on the refined hypothesis chains and KG-supported evidence, identifying high-priority candidates for experimental validation. Weak points in the hypothesis chain are further optimized through visual analytics of the retrieval results. We evaluated the effectiveness of HypoChainer in hypothesis construction and scientific discovery through case studies in two distinct domains and expert interviews.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"shishh2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Shaohan Shi"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"yaoyj2024@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Yunjie Yao"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Clinical Research and Trial Center","email":"cjiang_fdu@yeah.net","name":"Chang Jiang"},{"affiliation":"ShanghaiTech University","email":"liquan@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Quan Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jianghr2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn","name":"Haoran Jiang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"c06df49a-9aa2-40f9-94b9-23789ec137b8","image_caption":"Researchers engaged in scientific discovery, professionals in biology or related fields, and scholars in the field of visualization.","keywords":["Large Language Model","Visual Analytics","Iterative Human-AI Collaboration","Knowledge Graph","Hypothesis Construction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1399-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTM5OS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDJ9.uqob9O2eV8mKwyMoelby34k0iEE42K_bsg1dL0VrQws","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1399-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=0aac926027fca65d8a836215cd691d8ebb7a674984a73635bc2377a1e0d3dbaf","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1399-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=8907e3e3674dcc41deaa6d9001226b7e73505beb16748e5ac578ebaa45678cf6","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17209","program_paper_id":"1399","title":"HypoChainer: A Collaborative System Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Hypothesis-Driven Scientific Discovery","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:12:23.198291+00:00"},{"abstract":"In sports analytics, tactical visualization is widely used to convey valuable insights. However, due to the complex domain knowledge and contextual information involved in tactical visualizations, it is challenging for users to connect high-level tactical insights to corresponding visual patterns. This requires users to engage in a reasoning process to interpret insights within game contexts, which remains insufficiently supported in existing visual-text linking studies. In this work, we propose InsightChaser, a novel approach to bridge tactical insights and soccer visualizations through visual-text linking and visual reasoning enhancement. InsightChaser constructs knowledge graphs to represent both visual elements and contextual game information. Integrating large language models (LLMs), our approach retrieves relevant visual elements and establishes explicit links with insights. Moreover, InsightChaser utilizes LLMs to enhance these visual-text links by providing reasoning explanations and visual effects. We further develop an interactive visualization system that supports navigation and explanation of enhanced visual-text links. Users can explore linked tactical insights interactively and reason through enhanced visual explanations. We conduct two case studies using real-world soccer data and a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"ziao_liu@outlook.com","name":"Ziao Liu"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"zhao_ws@zju.edu.cn","name":"Wenshuo Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"xxie@zju.edu.cn","name":"Xiao Xie"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"caoanqi28@163.com","name":"Anqi Cao"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wuyihong0606@gmail.com","name":"Yihong Wu"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"zhang_hui@zju.edu.cn","name":"Hui Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"ycwu@zju.edu.cn","name":"Yingcai Wu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ziao_liu@outlook.com","name":"Ziao Liu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"ce206043-1fa9-45b7-801b-2910c1dec585","image_caption":"This work will interest sports analysts, data journalists, and visualization designers who aim to communicate sports tactical insights more effectively.

Despite their popularity, selecting meaningful projection parameters remains a key challenge due to the infi nite 2n-dimensional\nparameter space. Once an informative projection is found, users often seek similar ones that emphasize specifi c items differently\nwhile preserving global structure. For instance: Do clusters become outliers under slight changes? Can grouped items separate\u2014or\nmerge\u2014through parameter adjustments?

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"changjianchen@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Changjian Chen"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feilv@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Fei Lyu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"ztang@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Zhuo Tang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"yanglixt@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Li Yang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"wanglong8591@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Long Wang"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"caiyong911@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Yong Cai"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"feng_yu@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Feng Yu"},{"affiliation":"Hunan University","email":"lkl@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Kenli Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wangpengcheng@hnu.edu.cn","name":"Pengcheng Wang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"4009fec8-7d38-4e00-9e7d-f9493fb32941","image_caption":"This paper on hybrid rice breeding, is relevant to bioinformaticians and data scientists.

Although genAI affords facile production of aesthetic visuals for biological and medical content, the architecture of these tools fundamentally limits the accuracy and trustworthiness of the depicted information, from imaginary (or fanciful) molecules to alien anatomy. Through 17 interviews with a diverse group of practitioners and researchers, we qualitatively analyze the concerns and values driving genAI (dis)use for the visual representation of spatially oriented biomedical data. We find that BioMedVis experts, both in roles as developers and designers, use genAI tools at different stages of their daily workflows and hold attitudes ranging from enthusiastic adopters to skeptical avoiders of genAI. In contrasting the current use and perspectives on genAI observed in our study with predictions towards genAI in the visualization pipeline from prior work, we refocus the discussion of genAI\u2019s effects on projects in visualization in the here and now with its respective opportunities and pitfalls for future visualization research. At a time when public trust in science is in jeopardy, we are reminded to first do no harm, not just in biomedical visualization but in science communication more broadly.

One recent class of methods to approach this problem is to first compute objective optimal reference frames, relative to which the input vector field becomes as steady as possible. However, existing methods either optimize locally over a fixed neighborhood, which might not match the extent of interesting features well, or perform global optimization, which is costly. We propose a novel objective method for the computation of optimal reference frames that automatically adapts to the flow field locally, without having to choose neighborhoods a priori. We enable adaptivity by formulating this problem as a moving least squares approximation, through which we determine a continuous field of reference frames. To incorporate fluid features into the computation of the reference frame field, we introduce the use of a scalar guidance field into the moving least squares approximation. The guidance field determines a curved manifold on which a regularly sampled input vector field becomes a set of irregularly spaced samples, which then forms the input to the moving least squares approximation. Although the guidance field can be any scalar field, by using a field that corresponds to flow features the resulting reference frame field will adapt accordingly. We show that using an FTLE field as the guidance field results in a reference frame field that adapts better to local features in the flow than prior work. However, our moving least squares framework is formulated in a very general way, and therefore other types of guidance fields could be used in the future to adapt to local fluid features.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology - KAUST","email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Rey Ramirez"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"peter.rautek@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Peter Rautek"},{"affiliation":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg","email":"tobias.guenther@fau.de","name":"Tobias G\u00fcnther"},{"affiliation":"KAUST","email":"markus.hadwiger@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Markus Hadwiger"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"julio.reyramirez@kaust.edu.sa","name":"Julio Alberto Rey Ramirez"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"b71e9ec2-8579-410a-94c0-a9e2812a2712","image_caption":"Flow visualization scientists can apply this work to extend existing local reference frame optimization to turbulent flow, enabling the application of reference frame optimization in fields ranging from engineering to biomedical applications, where extracting vortex coreline geometry enables a quantitative study of the fluid dynamics","keywords":["Scientific visualization","unsteady flow","reference frame optimization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1172-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTE3Mi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MjYzLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAyNjN9.78GTaGloI7TAs3J-9fmByg1QPKPJIID7DkG6hQPYm1g","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1172-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=aeea7f3f54f385493bcd4c14f7125cbf9e9f46767499238e52da2f8488efc46a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1172-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=bc3011073e2a6e156ff14e31fa021d2f7d2577d2021f86601ab2d5aae0d26a4c","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1172","title":"Locally Adapted Reference Frame Fields using Moving Least Squares","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:11:03.75661+00:00"},{"abstract":"We propose manvr3d, a VR platform for immersive, AI-assisted human-in-the-loop cell tracking.

Deep Learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated, high-quality ground truth data and curation.

We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the third dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.

Thus, their performance degrades when applied to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.

The substantial variability in the categories and structures of labeled objects leads to diverse label layouts. Recent single-model learning-based solutions in label placement struggle to capture fine-grained differences between these layouts, which in turn limits their performance. In addition, although human designers often consult previous works to gain design insights, existing label layouts typically serve merely as training data, limiting the extent to which embedded design knowledge can be exploited. To address these challenges, we propose a mixture of cluster-guided experts (MoCE) solution for label placement. In this design, multiple experts jointly refine layout features, with each expert responsible for a specific cluster of layouts. A cluster-based gating function assigns input samples to experts based on representation clustering. We implement this idea through the Label Placement Cluster-guided Experts (LPCE) model, in which a MoCE layer integrates multiple feed-forward networks (FFNs), with each expert composed of a pair of FFNs.

INRs represent scalar fields based on sampled coordinates, typically using either a single network for the entire field or multiple networks across different spatial domains. However, these approaches often face challenges in modeling complex patterns and introducing boundary artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-INR, an INR architecture based on a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. MoE-INR automates irregular subdivisions of spatiotemporal fields and dynamically assigns them to different expert networks. The architecture comprises three key components: a policy network, a shared encoder, and multiple expert decoders. The policy network subdivides the field and determines which expert decoder is responsible for a given input coordinate. The shared encoder extracts hidden representations from the input coordinates, and the expert decoders transform these high-dimensional features into scalar values. This design results in a unified framework accommodating diverse INR types, including conventional, grid-based, and ensemble. We evaluate the effectiveness of MoE-INR on multiple time-varying datasets with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-INR significantly outperforms existing non-MoE and MoE-based INRs and traditional lossy compression methods across quantitative and qualitative metrics under various compression ratios.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"ktang2@nd.edu","name":"Kaiyuan Tang"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"junhanvis@outlook.com","name":"Jun Han"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9af6703f-fc27-4be6-a995-f84e8091b517","image_caption":"simulation scientists and data scientists","keywords":["Time-varying data compression","implicit neural representation","volume visualization","mixture-of-experts"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1023-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTAyMy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYyLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjJ9.n8moh3uK60FRB9qvPPqWOSFYUnckICZpHU_ESpQZi6c","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1023-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=5438629085ccfd85887afa6714eda3bc711a430556913f3d75c70359020046c1","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1023-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=3d9177d3782fc2aa0a822cab3aa3054187f052ff8b9d48d0a58bd93059bf29b1","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1023","title":"MoE-INR: Implicit Neural Representation with Mixture-of-Experts for Time-Varying Volumetric Data Compression","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:01:03.310014+00:00"},{"abstract":"Connectomics, a subfield of neuroscience, reconstructs structural and functional brain maps at synapse-level resolution. These complex spatial maps consist of tree-like neurons interconnected by synapses. Motif analysis is a widely used method for identifying recurring subgraph patterns in connectomes. These motifs, thus, potentially represent fundamental units of information processing. However, existing computational tools often oversimplify neurons as mere nodes in a graph, disregarding their intricate morphologies. In this paper, we introduce MoMo, a novel interactive visualization framework for analyzing neuron morphology-aware motifs in large connectome graphs. First, we propose an advanced graph data structure that integrates both neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. This enables highly efficient, parallel subgraph isomorphism searches, allowing for interactive morphological motif queries. Second, we develop a sketch-based interface that facilitates the intuitive exploration of morphology-based motifs within our new data structure. Users can conduct interactive motif searches on state-of-the-art connectomes and visualize results as interactive 3D renderings. We present a detailed goal and task analysis for motif exploration in connectomes, incorporating neuron morphology. Finally, we evaluate MoMo through case studies with four domain experts, who asses the tool\u2019s usefulness and effectiveness in motif exploration, and relevance to real-world neuroscience research.

Such selections may span multiple components, combine in complex ways, and require optimizations to ensure low-latency updates. We describe Mosaic Selections, a model for representing, managing, and optimizing user selections, in which one or more filter predicates are added to queries that request data for visualizations and input widgets. By analyzing both queries and selection predicates, Mosaic Selections enable automatic optimizations, including pre-aggregating data to rapidly compute selection updates. We contribute a formal description of our selection model and optimization methods, and their implementation in the open-source Mosaic architecture. Benchmark results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude latency improvements for selection-based optimizations over unoptimized queries and existing optimizers for the Vega language. The Mosaic Selection model provides infrastructure for flexible, interoperable filtering across multiple visualizations, alongside automatic optimizations to scale to millions and even billions of records.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"},{"affiliation":"Carnegie Mellon University","email":"domoritz@cmu.edu","name":"Dominik Moritz"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"603070d4-693a-4aec-8b08-632a59a24c59","image_caption":"Visualization developers, data system developers, and data engineers could apply the techniques in this paper to provide scalable, interactive data interfaces.","keywords":["scalable visualization","interactive selection","multiple coordinated views","brushing and linking","user interfaces"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic-selection-benchmarks","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1313-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTMxMy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0MzQxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODAzNDF9.rsrZ1WZFt2qnjsrTcKKfaI-_ub8r4UNonguKKcb_6Pk","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1313-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=64ed82ebecff23cf3350701e21edee9776555e0f7da3a078d243b292f4d6070d","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1313-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=d820370f98bd392c2c6c7b6f522fc8d19823eb8a8216166400cb093e98c4a4fb","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19690","program_paper_id":"1313","title":"Mosaic Selections: Managing and Optimizing User Selections for Scalable Data Visualization Systems","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:12:23.194478+00:00"},{"abstract":"Detecting and interpreting common patterns in relational data is crucial for understanding complex topological structures across various domains. These patterns, or network motifs, can often be detected algorithmically. However, visual inspection remains vital for exploring and discovering patterns. This paper focuses on presenting motifs within BioFabric network visualizations---a unique technique that opens opportunities for research on scaling to larger networks, design variations, and layout algorithms to better expose motifs. Our goal is to show how highlighting motifs can assist users in identifying and interpreting patterns in BioFabric visualizations. To this end, we leverage existing motif simplification techniques. We replace edges with glyphs representing fundamental motifs such as staircases, cliques, paths, and connector nodes. The results of our controlled experiment and usage scenarios demonstrate that motif simplification for BioFabric is useful for detecting and interpreting network patterns. Our participants were faster and more confident using the simplified view without sacrificing accuracy. The efficacy of our current motif simplification approach depends on which extant layout algorithm is used. We hope our promising findings on user performance will motivate future research on layout algorithms tailored to maximizing motif presentation.

However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify desired viewpoints that align with the user\u2019s intent. The selected viewpoints are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex scientific phenomena.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"zhaox269@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Xuan Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Sun Yat-sen University","email":"taoj23@mail.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Jun Tao"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhaox269@mail2.sysu.edu.cn","name":"Xuan Zhao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3f463b80-5efc-4150-8b6f-3f5fbb1aed72","image_caption":"Target practitioners include scientific visualization developers working with volumetric datasets such as CT scans, fluid simulations, or biological reconstructions.\nThey can benefit from the system's natural language-driven navigation and semantic block encoding to streamline 3D data exploration.","keywords":["Volume rendering","Viewpoint navigation","Natural language interaction"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/2050-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMjA1MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTQ5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5NDl9.fqyrBAQ5IV5eD2gNdn8TT112QzkbJwZ21L-1X7ylOCs","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub2050-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=07c40358564ac43e2296389968574c0d7792b2b41c408b61f3b0e393931b838b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub2050-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=1cc039c06eba2a5b861dd6fce829a316442bd58e97a5b9d3e5588cb277b381fd","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"2050","title":"Natural Language-Driven Viewpoint Navigation for Volume Exploration via Semantic Block Representation","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:29.811405+00:00"},{"abstract":"Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities, frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood preservation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"rebecca.kehlbeck@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Rebecca Kehlbeck"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"yumeng.xue@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Yumeng Xue"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"bin.chen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Bin Chen"},{"affiliation":"Renmin University of China","email":"cloudseawang@gmail.com","name":"Yunhai Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"oliver.deussen@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Oliver Deussen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"patrick.paetzold@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Patrick Paetzold"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"093d9538-804e-4951-a5bf-dab72e99c35d","image_caption":"Treemaps are a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data.\nAmong them, Voronoi treemaps are particularly appreciated for their organic appearance.

To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel Crop-Smoothing technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations\u2014including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes.  A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"jwduan@csu.edu.cn","name":"Junwen Duan"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"scv.kangziyao@gmail.com","name":"Ziyao Kang"},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","email":"shixia@tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Shixia Liu"},{"affiliation":"Central South University","email":"xiajiazhi@csu.edu.cn","name":"Jiazhi Xia"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"234711076@csu.edu.cn","name":"Wei Xue"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"a79b8861-5ff1-41ab-ab84-c564496de8de","image_caption":"Visualization Practitioners, AI Researchers, Computer Vision Specialists","keywords":["Open-world object detection","data-efficient supervision","large language model","human-AI collaboration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1774-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc3NC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.BEGW-Le6DtEV9jjO9GwDXzuko0mWcfL3cxRGM2ja92U","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1774-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f6d7cd02bdef53fa25a2a7093c2ee31fb91f4d13952fbff4068b03978648b9c7","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1774-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=29e6b6ea300d22c2f8df480083a3b263d71098e846f5b90559fbdbd440dcadb7","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19870","program_paper_id":"1774","title":"OW-CLIP: Data-Efficient Visual Supervision for Open-World Object Detection via Human-AI Collaboration","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.667457+00:00"},{"abstract":"Ownership relationships of early printed books from the 15th century reveal complex patterns of distribution and possession, offering valuable insights for historical research.

Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized interface for model-application communication, which facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs and ParaView's Python API, allowing seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples, closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"miao1@llnl.gov","name":"Haichao Miao"},{"affiliation":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory","email":"bremer5@llnl.gov","name":"Peer-Timo Bremer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"shusen.liu.hust@gmail.com","name":"Shusen Liu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:16.839835+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"881a464d-c01d-453c-8f14-8b59acdde104","image_caption":"domain scientists / user who want to use paraview to generate visualization but never have time to learn it.","keywords":["Agent","Tool Use","Model Context Protocol"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/LLNL/paraview_mcp","open_access_supplemental_question":"Well documented source code","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1100-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMDAtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.YibVKkYT_n4KY0LL-mvnB6_KSUZ0vnb290OeagWz5Kc","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1100-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=f0af2a18526aa8f31edd0ed085fac7e7ba4722b791400aa38031ba72b1a2ae2c","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1100-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062639Z&X-Amz-Signature=5be08d8c3d8eac67c894b90795d40dc0e0086b23f3de722e2f3eb6c1932bfc7a","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07064","program_paper_id":"1100","title":"Paraview-MCP: An Autonomous Visualization Agent with Direct Tool Use","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:38:59.943811+00:00"},{"abstract":"Sonification offers a non-visual way to understand data, with pitch-based encodings being the most common. Yet, how well people perceive slope and acceleration\u2014key features of data trends\u2014remains poorly understood. Drawing on people's natural abilities to perceive tempo, we introduce a novel sampling method for pitch-based sonification to enhance the perception of slope and acceleration in univariate functions. While traditional sonification methods often sample data at uniform x-spacing, yielding notes played at a fixed tempo with variable pitch intervals (Variable Pitch Interval), our approach samples at uniform y-spacing, producing notes with consistent pitch intervals but variable tempo (Variable Tempo). We conducted psychoacoustic experiments to understand slope and acceleration perception across three sampling methods: Variable Pitch Interval, Variable Tempo, and a Continuous (no sampling) baseline. In slope comparison tasks, Variable Tempo was more accurate than the other methods when modulated by the magnitude ratio between slopes. For acceleration perception, just-noticeable differences under Variable Tempo were over 13 times finer than with other methods. Participants also commonly reported higher confidence, lower mental effort, and a stronger preference for Variable Tempo compared to other methods. This work contributes models of slope and acceleration perception across pitch-based sonification techniques, introduces Variable Tempo as a novel and preferred sampling method, and provides promising initial evidence that leveraging timing can lead to more sensitive, accurate, and precise interpretation of derivative-based data features.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"walksmit@stanford.edu","name":"Walker Smith"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"takako@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Takako Fujioka"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"cc@ccrma.stanford.edu","name":"Chris Chafe"},{"affiliation":"University of Michigan","email":"sileo@umich.edu","name":"Sile O'Modhrain"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"othello5@stanford.edu","name":"Diana Deutsch"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"sfollmer@stanford.edu","name":"Sean Follmer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"danfan17@stanford.edu","name":"Danyang Fan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"9e3dfe2c-bbe4-4431-ae8b-1ee64a399c8b","image_caption":"This research demonstrates that Variable Tempo sampling in pitch sonification\u2014sampling data at equal y-intervals to create tempo changes reflecting slope\u2014can enable more accurate and precise slope comparison and finer curvature discrimination compared to traditional pitch-based methods.

Current scatterplot abstraction methods lose features in medium-to-low density regions. We propose a visual abstraction method designed to provide better feature preservation across arbitrary abstraction levels for large-scale scatterplots, particularly in medium-to-low density regions. The method consists of three closely interconnected steps: first, we partition the scatterplot into iso-density regions and equalize visual density; then, we allocate pixels for different classes within each region; finally, we reconstruct the data distribution based on pixels. User studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach better preserves features and exhibits a special advantage when handling ultra-high dynamic range data distributions.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Visual Computing Lab","email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"tianxiangwei@tju.edu.cn","name":"Tianxiang Wei"},{"affiliation":"Communication University of China","email":"lzyfun@cuc.edu.cn","name":"Zeyu Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"lianghaozhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Lianghao Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"sisilee144144@gmail.com","name":"Sisi Li"},{"affiliation":"Tianjin University","email":"jwzhang@tju.edu.cn","name":"Jiawan Zhang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"sygzh6@tju.edu.cn","name":"Ziheng Guo"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"76560e50-f8e7-446f-943e-2ba7ff188c86","image_caption":"This paper is for practitioners like data scientists, ML engineers, and bioinformaticians who need to visualize massive datasets, such as those from dimensionality reduction.

This highlights the need for intelligent assistance mechanisms.\nHowever, even the latest LLM-assisted VA systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting.  The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further exploration.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Fudan Univerisity","email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"3504936154@qq.com","name":"Xueli Shu"},{"affiliation":"Beijing Institute of Technology","email":"flwfdd@gmail.com","name":"Liwen Fan"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"lgao.lynne@gmail.com","name":"Lin Gao"},{"affiliation":"University of Oxford","email":"yuzhang94@outlook.com","name":"Yu Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"simingchen3@gmail.com","name":"Siming Chen"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yuhengzhao_cn@163.com","name":"Yuheng Zhao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"47c46990-8edb-4014-be27-c1c07f128d60","image_caption":"Algorithm developer,  LLM application developer, Visual analyst, Data scientist, Data Manager, HCI and Visual analyst researcher","keywords":["Visual analytics","mixed-initiative","large language model","interface agent","proactive agent","human-AI collaboration"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1045-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTA0NS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjYxLCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjF9.ioTHCDTYphNutdQJB7qROsJMPAXYI2P50u1SjY2GWcA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1045-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=1fc7160b71987616b9720f054e1db0dff1fcab316da453a52850c1efec080c2b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1045-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=eb4642447eacb7f0f7794d1249b0b31758891b51c5ce1f0f45f67e17b843378f","preprint_link":"https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.18165","program_paper_id":"1045","title":"ProactiveVA: Proactive Visual Analytics with LLM-based UI Agent","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:01:02.560232+00:00"},{"abstract":"Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate promising chart comprehension capabilities. Yet, prior explorations of their visualization literacy have been limited to assessing their response correctness and fail to explore their internal reasoning. To address this gap, we adapted attention-guided class activation maps (AG-CAM) for VLMs to visualize the influence and importance of input features (image and text) on model responses.  Using this approach,  we conducted an examination of four open-source (ChartGemma, Janus 1B and 7B, and LLaVA) and two closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) models comparing their performance and, for the open-source models, their AG-CAM results. Overall, we found that ChartGemma, a 3B parameter VLM fine-tuned for chart question-answering (QA), outperformed other open-source models and exhibited performance on par with significantly larger closed-source VLMs. We also found that VLMs exhibit spatial reasoning by accurately localizing key chart features, and semantic reasoning by associating visual elements with corresponding data values and query tokens. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the use of AG-CAM on early fusion VLM architectures, which are widely used, and for chart QA. We also show preliminary evidence that these results can align with human reasoning. Our promising open-source VLMs results pave the way for transparent and reproducible research in AI visualization literacy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"a7dong@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Lianghan Dong"},{"affiliation":"University of Waterloo","email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amcrisan@uwaterloo.ca","name":"Anamaria Crisan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6f935187-a32b-477d-90a0-1a7e959c6222","image_caption":"Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, AI Engineers","keywords":["Vision Language Models","Visualization Literacy","Explainability","Chart Question and Answering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/fp3rg/","open_access_supplemental_question":"Novel methods, open source code, live demo","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1740-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTc0MC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.cc7gYgPLj5k-xArGkxlKK5g4imTZxOi6lW4WL9V-B5s","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1740-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=fc5870b2bbb08616ab6ddb8a526da85f6c6f4bb1e070ad32653d7c42e9271fc6","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1740-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=50da6c2b50a57f354b857829bdebdd81aeee06c2ee66b493280d38d77a36e39d","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05445","program_paper_id":"1740","title":"Probing the Visualization Literacy of Vision Language Models: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.780974+00:00"},{"abstract":"Psychomare is an artistic research project that explores the visualization of nightmares through a psychoanalytic and XR-based performance methodology.

Utilizing AI-driven imagery, embodied dance performance, and virtual production technologies, Psychomare creates an immersive dreamscape where the dancer confronts surreal nightmare entities derived from personal and collective dream memories. Drawing on Lacanian theory, the work proposes that nightmares emerge from a misrecognition of the self\u2014a mirrored distortion of unconscious desires and fears projected onto dream imagery. This symbolic misrecognition becomes the conceptual core of the project, guiding its aesthetic and choreographic strategies. Feedback from the dancer, audience, and a psychoanalyst reveals strong emotional resonance and aesthetic depth, suggesting that the visualization of nightmares can foster self-reflection, emotional confrontation, and collective empathy.

While run-time optimizations such as caching and data tiling improve interaction latency, these approaches leave initial load performance unoptimized. In this work, we investigate _publish-time optimizations_ that shift computational work ahead of user sessions to accelerate both loading and interaction. We organize the space of publish-time optimizations into categories of data preparation, pre-computation of data assets for optimization, and pre-rendering; and then reason about tradeoffs in terms of time-to-render (TTR), time-to-activation (TTA), and storage cost (SC). To assess their effectiveness, we implement publish-time optimizations for the open-source Mosaic architecture and evaluate their impact across varied visualizations and dataset sizes. On average, publish-time strategies reduced rendering latency by 83.7% and activation latency by 33.3%, demonstrating their value for improving the performance of web-based visualizations.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"jheer@uw.edu","name":"Jeffrey Heer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"rpechuk@uw.edu","name":"Ron Pechuk"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.063302+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"32ebace7-cf30-462d-b6a4-40a3e39c6226","image_caption":"Practitioners who author and/or deploy interactive web-based visualizations or visualization systems will find this paper the most relevant.

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to enhance the design study process, providing capabilities such as creative problem-solving, data handling, and insightful analysis. However, despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of systematic understanding of how LLMs can effectively assist researchers in visualization-specific design studies. In this paper, we conducted a multi-stage qualitative study to fill this gap, which involved 30 design study researchers from diverse backgrounds and expertise levels. Through in-depth interviews and carefully-designed questionnaires, we investigated strategies for utilizing LLMs, the challenges encountered, and the practices used to overcome them. We further compiled the roles that LLMs can play across different stages of the design study process. Our findings highlight practical implications to inform visualization practitioners, and also provide a framework for leveraging LLMs to facilitate the design study process in visualization research.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"},{"affiliation":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","email":"rshengac@connect.ust.hk","name":"Rui Sheng"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"xiaolin004@e.ntu.edu.sg","name":"Xiaolin Wen"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"wangjiachen@zju.edu.cn","name":"Jiachen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"tianyizhang.2023@phdcs.smu.edu.sg","name":"Tianyi Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Nanyang Technological University","email":"yong-wang@ntu.edu.sg","name":"Yong WANG"},{"affiliation":"Monash University","email":"tgdwyer@gmail.com","name":"Tim Dwyer"},{"affiliation":"Singapore Management University","email":"jiannanli@smu.edu.sg","name":"Jiannan Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"haywardryan@foxmail.com","name":"Shaolun Ruan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"29656e00-00d7-4080-b589-2d7c838c72be","image_caption":"Visualization Researchers, Data Scientists, UX/UI Designers, HCI Researchers, LLM Practioners/Researchers","keywords":["Design Study","Large Language Models (LLMs)","Qualitative Study","Visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1207-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTIwNy1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNzQ0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk3NDR9.Xm6xxvxQDptDJdkDmxBnwimXfCXJWcnFbdh0c-4JQJA","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1207-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=6f89df6310b0276bda3ce670ba97cc6dbd78d1728d5f22d39aa2adafdbe8537f","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1207-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=b95da05e47ecf620a46dac5bf1886fab55d93e60be2ed66153815ceecc0175c0","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10024","program_paper_id":"1207","title":"Qualitative Study for LLM-assisted Design Study Process: Strategies, Challenges, and Roles","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:02:25.093908+00:00"},{"abstract":"What impressions might readers form with visualizations that go beyond the data they encode?

After two years since these techniques were publicly available, it is important to reflect our progress of applying them and have an outlook for future opportunities. To achieve the goal, we compare the collaboration patterns of the latest tools with those of earlier ones using a dedicated framework for understanding human-AI collaboration in data storytelling. Through comparison, we identify consistently widely studied patterns, e.g., human-creator + AI-assistant, and newly explored or emerging ones, e.g., AI-creator + human-reviewer. The benefits of these AI techniques and implications to human-AI collaboration are also revealed.

Although patterns have long been used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of pattern and texture. As a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables: the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual primitives. We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization theory and highlight opportunities for visualization design. We further explore patterns based on complex spatial arrangements, demonstrating explanatory power and connecting our conceptualization to broader theory on maps and cartography.

Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"huayuan221@gmail.com","name":"Huayuan Ye"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"10215102469@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"He Zhu"},{"affiliation":"Zhejiang University","email":"siwei.fu@zju.edu.cn","name":"Siwei Fu"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.428207+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"10233019-3fcc-4f01-b478-96b0ec01cf29","image_caption":"Geoscientists, climate engineers/researchers, and general visualization designers.","keywords":["Spatial interpolation","spatiotemporal data","uncertainty visualization","graph neural network"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/jtchen2k/relmap/","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1643-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTY0My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM2LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzZ9.VbKEt3BC9JXh9Vy6Ok4WM2w7qQIRLQlLukPzYz7pkV0","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1643-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=9e8216b64c6afcc619f2f1d47cd7b1a4eb581af6ac2a0a3a977e86cd51db321b","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1643-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054742Z&X-Amz-Signature=546124035a28359081949eadb7a45882f27a709870209a78c89fd010fe8bb820","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01240","program_paper_id":"1643","title":"RelMap: Reliable Spatiotemporal Sensor Data Visualization via Imputative Spatial Interpolation","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:15:37.992798+00:00"},{"abstract":"The recent adoption of artificial intelligence in socio-technical systems raises concerns about the black-box nature of the resulting decisions in fields such as hiring, finance, admissions, etc. If data subjects\u2014such as job applicants, loan applicants, and students\u2014receive an unfavorable outcome, they may be interested in algorithmic recourse, which involves updating certain features to yield a more favorable result when re-evaluated by algorithmic decision-making. Unfortunately, when individuals do not fully understand the incremental steps needed to change their circumstances, they risk following misguided paths that can lead to significant, long-term adverse consequences. Existing recourse approaches focus exclusively on the final recourse goal but neglect the possible incremental steps to reach the goal with real-life constraints, user preferences, and model artifacts. To address this gap, we formulate a visual analytic workflow for incremental recourse planning in collaboration with AI/ML experts and contribute an interactive visualization interface that helps data subjects efficiently navigate the recourse alternatives and make an informed decision. We present a usage scenario and subjective feedback from observational studies with twelve graduate students using a real-world dataset, which demonstrates that our approach can be instrumental for data subjects in choosing a suitable recourse path.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"jy448@njit.edu","name":"Jun Yuan"},{"affiliation":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","email":"dasgupta.aritra@gmail.com","name":"Aritra Dasgupta"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kaustavbhatt94@gmail.com","name":"Kaustav Bhattacharjee"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"0ecc86cf-63c0-4483-9849-b207a438bb59","image_caption":"This work would be useful for practitioners interested in developing solutions for algorithmic recourse\u2014that is, providing remedy options for individuals affected by model-driven decisions.

Our analysis of this design space highlights an emerging trend: a shift from on-body, peripersonal visualisations (i.e., in the space within direct reach, such as visualisations on a smartwatch or a mobile phone display) towards extrapersonal displays (i.e., in the space beyond immediate reach, such as visualisations in immersive augmented reality displays) that integrate data in the runner\u2019s surrounding environment. We explore this opportunity by conducting a series of workshops with 10 active runners in total, eliciting design concepts for running visualisations and interactions beyond conventional 2D displays.

Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations.

However, these visualizations and contextual images typically remain separated, limiting their combined narrative expressiveness and engagement. Achieving this is challenging due to the need for fine-grained alignment and creative ideation. To address this, we present SceneLoom, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-powered system that facilitates the coordination of data visualization with real-world imagery based on narrative intents. Through a formative study, we investigated the design space of coordination relationships between data visualization and real-world scenes from the perspectives of visual alignment and semantic coherence. Guided by the derived design considerations, SceneLoom leverages VLMs to extract visual and semantic features from scene images and data visualization, and perform design mapping through a reasoning process that incorporates spatial organization, shape similarity, layout consistency, and semantic binding.

The current form of training and coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen, 5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases and supported understanding across skill levels.

However, these techniques typically abstract away crucial spatial, positional, and morphological contexts, complicating interpretation and limiting insights. To address these limitations, we present SEAL, an interactive visual analytics system designed to bridge the gap between abstract 2D embeddings and their rich spatial imaging context. SEAL introduces a novel hybrid-embedding visualization that preserves image and morphological information while integrating critical high-dimensional feature data. By adapting set visualization methods, SEAL allows analysts to identify, visualize, and compare selections\u2014defined manually or algorithmically\u2014in both the embedding and original spatial views, facilitating a deeper understanding of the spatial arrangement and morphological characteristics of entities of interest. To elucidate differences between selected sets of items, SEAL employs a scalable surrogate model to calculate feature importance scores, identifying the most influential features governing the position of objects within embeddings. These importance scores are visually summarized across selections, with mathematical set operations enabling detailed comparative analyses. We demonstrate SEAL's effectiveness and versatility through three case studies: colorectal cancer tissue analysis with a pharmacologist, melanoma investigation with a cell biologist, and exploration of sky survey data with an astronomer. These studies underscore the importance of integrating image context into embedding spaces when interpreting complex imaging datasets. Implemented as a standalone tool while also integrating seamlessly with computational notebooks, SEAL provides an interactive platform for spatially informed exploration of high-dimensional datasets, significantly enhancing interpretability and insight generation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"simonwarchol@g.harvard.edu","name":"Simon Warchol"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"gguo31@g.harvard.edu","name":"Grace Guo"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"jknittel@seas.harvard.edu","name":"Johannes Knittel"},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"dfreeman@g.harvard.edu","name":"Dan Freeman"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"usha_bhalla@g.harvard.edu","name":"Usha Bhalla"},{"affiliation":"Harvard Medical School","email":"jeremy_muhlich@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Jeremy Muhlich"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"peter_sorger@hms.harvard.edu","name":"Peter Sorger"},{"affiliation":"Harvard University","email":"pfister@seas.harvard.edu","name":"Hanspeter Pfister"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"simonwarchol@g.harvard.edu","name":"Simon Alexander Warchol"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.629466+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3eefd0dc-4542-4d3b-8a9e-bd1530cdebab","image_caption":"Practitioners who work with high-dimensional data linked to spatial or image context\u2014such as single-cell biologists, geospatial analysts, and astrophysicists\u2014can use SEAL\u2019s hybrid embedding and spatial-image views to map clusters and outliers back to real-world coordinates.

Despite that, they experience notable performance drops when subjected to realistic transformations in input data. Analyzing model behavior under input transformations is essential to preemptively identify possible\nbreaking points and understand what image characteristics might cause them before their failure in the real world. We introduce SEG-RobustEye, a visual analytics (VA) design developed to assist in the evaluation of the robustness of segmentation models for endoscopy images under realistic input transformations. SEG-RobustEye is based on ProactiV [13], a VA framework designed for understanding the behaviour of image-to-image translation models. SEG-RobustEye is a tailored instance of the framework and an extension of ProactiV for medical images, in concrete endoscopic images. These require visual designs that enhance the relevant features for such medical applications, which are different from general natural scenes. SEG-RobustEye is designed to discover features that affect the model behaviour under specific transformations.\nSEG-RobustEye connects the provided perspectives by ProactiV, i.e., global and instance level, and extends to subgroup level patterns. Subgroup level patterns facilitate the discovery and generalizability of selected subgroups of instances.

In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.

However, the set-size effect when perceiving multiple SF based items remains unclear. While automatic feature extraction has been found to be less affected by set size (number of items in a group), higher-level processes for making perceptual decisions tend to require increased cognitive demand. To investigate the set-size effect on comparing integrated SF based items, we used a risk-based scenario to assess discrimination performance. Participants were asked to discriminate between pairs of maps containing multiple SF glyphs, in which each glyph represents one of four discrete levels (none, low, medium, high), forming an aggregate \u201crisk strength\u201d per map. The set size was also adjusted across conditions, ranging from small (3 items) to large (7 items). Discrimination sensitivity is modeled with a logistic function and response time with a mixed-effect linear model. Results show that smaller set sizes and lower overall strength enable more precise discrimination, with faster response times for larger differences between maps. Incorporating set size and overall strength into the logistic model, we found that these variables both independently and jointly influence discrimination sensitivity. We suggest these results point towards capacity-limited processes rather than purely automatic ensemble coding. Our findings highlight the importance of set size and overall signal strength when presenting multiple SF glyphs in data visualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"shan.shao@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Shan Shao"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"peter.baudains@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Peter Baudains"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"andrew.meso@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Andrew Meso"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"nickholliman@gmail.com","name":"Nick Holliman"},{"affiliation":"King's College London","email":"alfie.abdulrahman@gmail.com","name":"Alfie Abdul-Rahman"},{"affiliation":"Kings College London","email":"rita.borgo@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Rita Borgo"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yiran.2.li@kcl.ac.uk","name":"Yiran Li"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"1acd711b-69a4-486f-9955-0f6adb58292b","image_caption":"UX / HCI researchers and designers of decision-support tools: Our evidence of capacity-limited read-out helps determine how many glyphs a dashboard can display before precision falls, guiding choices about interface complexity, glyph density, and progressive-reveal interactions.\n\nData scientists and analysts who communicate risk: Our task mirrors real-world comparisons in traffic, natural-hazard, and climate-impact mapping.

Viewers are prone to misinterpret the direction of time in these visualizations, possibly because they encode time with an unexpected rule \u2013 along the connected line (TIME IS A LINE) instead of from left to right (RIGHT IS LATER) as conventional in line charts. In this paper, we use the connected scatterplot to illustrate a perspective on visualization comprehension centered around expectations of encoding rules. People have initial expectations of encoding rules for visualizations that can stem from conventional practices or metaphors, and these expectations have been recognized as a potential factor influencing visualization comprehension. We present three preregistered experiments (n = 1429 in total) demonstrating two kinds of design interventions to strengthen the correct expectation for time and testing their effectiveness in reducing errors for understanding realistic connected scatterplots. We found that visual treatments that suppress the incorrect chart-type expectation and directional cues that emphasize the correct expectation both led viewers to expect TIME IS A LINE more. An explicit directional cue (arrows), ideally redundantly encoded with another cue (trace-line effect or animation), was most effective for reducing misinterpretations. Our findings not only provide practical guidelines for designing connected scatterplots but also contribute theoretical insights to inform the design of novel visualizations that challenge interpretability by defying expectations.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"l.padilla@northeastern.edu","name":"Lace Padilla"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"wenxuxmn@gmail.com","name":"Wen Xu"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"cdeb2b03-68fd-4816-8611-544145e35ba2","image_caption":"This paper will be of interest for data journalists in particular.

However, it exhibits limitations in preserving the global structures of scatterplots with areas of varying density due to the incompatibility of adapting the granularity level of the underlying space-filling curve to regions with different densities. To compensate for this shortcoming, we introduce SiGrid that combines Hagrid with the Sector-Based Regularization (SBR) technique. SiGrid applies SBR to generate a scatterplot with a more uniform and generally lower density as an intermediate step. This intermediate scatterplot can then be fed to Hagrid for improved results.

The work translates pre-recorded neural activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons, into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio, living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment, filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara","email":"nefeli@ucsb.edu","name":"Nefeli Manoudaki"},{"affiliation":"University of California Santa Barbara","email":"merttoka@ucsb.edu","name":"Mert Toka"},{"affiliation":"University of California, Santa Barbara","email":"iason@ucsb.edu","name":"Iason Paterakis"},{"affiliation":"University of California Santa Barbara","email":"diarmid@ucsb.edu","name":"Diarmid Flatley"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"merttoka@ucsb.edu","name":"Mert Toka"}],"created_at":"2025-10-20T05:17:08.21762+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"a-visap","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"470f58d3-7a7a-47fd-baf3-82d155ac725b","image_caption":null,"keywords":["Artificial life","symbiosis","brain organoids","collective intelligence","generative ecosystem."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/a-visap/1116-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy9hLXZpc2FwLzExMTYtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDkzOTg2NCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDc1ODY0fQ.BnWj123e9So2nRhmm7Vin7u64bH8M0uKAXvtvM-F7O0","pmu_retrieve_link":null,"pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25h/vis25h-sub1116-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250826%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250826T225317Z&X-Amz-Signature=c04cfde03218014472e6faf4e646bf9cb85fc85ee7ffe66b2c627580677d42ef","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1116","title":"Simulacra Naturae: Generative Ecosystem driven by Agent-Based Simulations and Brain Organoid Collective Intelligence","updated_at":"2025-10-20T05:57:44.357048+00:00"},{"abstract":"Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), while effective in natural image understanding, struggle with visualization understanding due to their inability to decode the data-to-visual mapping and extract structured information.

The effectiveness of SimVec is demonstrated by using MLLMs to reconstruct chart information from SimVec formats.

We finetune state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., MiniCPM and Qwen-VL), using SimVecVis with different dataset dimensions.

From diverse data-tracking procedures, creators use and relate to data in varied ways. Working on these pieces also contributes to the creators\u2019 personal growth and data understanding.

This has led to the development of new techniques for street and pedestrian network visualization, expanding possibilities for effective data presentation and interpretation. Despite their increasing adoption, there is no established design framework to guide the creation of these visualizations while addressing the diverse requirements of various domains. When exploring a feature of interest, domain experts often need to transform, integrate, and visualize a combination of thematic data (e.g., demographic, socioeconomic, pollution) and physical data (e.g., zip codes, street networks), often spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. This not only complicates the process of visual data exploration and system implementation for developers but also creates significant entry barriers for experts who lack a background in programming. With this in mind, in this paper, we reviewed 45 studies utilizing street-overlaid visualizations to understand how they are applied in practice. Through qualitative coding of these visualizations, we analyzed three key aspects of street and pedestrian network visualization usage: their analytical purposes, the visualization approaches employed, and the data sources used in their creation. Building on this design space, we introduce StreetWeave, a declarative grammar for designing custom visualizations of multivariate spatial network data across multiple resolutions. We demonstrate how StreetWeave can be used to create various street-overlaid visualizations, enabling effective exploration and analysis of spatial data.

Existing tools primarily support single-model analysis and lack dedicated functionalities for multi-model comparison. As a result, engineers must rely on manual, cognitively demanding visual inspections, making it difficult to systematically identify and interpret stress variations across design iterations. To address these limitations, we propose StressDiffVis, a visual analytics approach that facilitates stress field comparison across multiple structural models. StressDiffVis employs a volumetric representation to encode stress distributions while minimizing occlusion, enabling voxel-wise difference analysis for model comparison. To support localized analysis, we introduce model segmentation, grouping voxels with similar stress patterns across models. StressDiffVis integrates these techniques into an interactive interface with a tree view, organizing models by the iterative design process, and a comparison view, using a matrix layout for detailed comparisons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StressDiffVis through two case studies illustrating its utility in comparative stress analysis. In addition, expert interviews confirm its potential to enhance engineering workflows.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"zkdeng@scut.edu.cn","name":"Zikun Deng"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"sehanlinsong@mail.scut.edu.cn","name":"Hanlin Song"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"xiangch.05@outlook.com","name":"Xiang Chen"},{"affiliation":"Greater Bay Area National Center of Technology Innovation","email":"gaoshaowu@ncti-gba.cn","name":"Shaowu Gao"},{"affiliation":"South China University of Technology","email":"ycai@scut.edu.cn","name":"Yi Cai"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"jiabaoh20@outlook.com","name":"Jiabao Huang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.772067+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"39db4241-5a8e-4bf7-abaf-b638cfbfee08","image_caption":"This paper is relevant to structural engineers, CAE practitioners, and simulation scientists involved in iterative design and stress analysis.

While the role of visual attention in visualization interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a 235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts (high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers) focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual data communication to enhance understanding.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"yao.wang@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Yao Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Washington","email":"wwill@cs.washington.edu","name":"Huichen Wang"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"zhouyuanhong0510@gmail.com","name":"Yuanhong Zhou"},{"affiliation":"University of Stuttgart","email":"andreas.bulling@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","name":"Andreas Bulling"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"minsuk@gatech.edu","name":"Minsuk Chang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"22ccb527-7a1d-49e1-81b8-9e4f335089e1","image_caption":"Vision Scientists \u2013 The study shows how people with different visualization skills look at charts differently, strongly related to vision science.\n\nVisualization Designers / UX Researchers \u2013 The Lit2Sal and Sal2Lit models help create personalized visualizations that match users' skill levels, making charts more effective and reducing confusion.

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging.

Previous work on visual semantics focused primarily on color, with the implicit assumption that color semantics is unaffected by changes in the size of the visualization (given sufficient perceptual discriminability across sizes). Changing size from small scale (e.g., small figures in a paper) to large scale (e.g., large figures in a slide presentation) is straightforward for visualizations that have solid colored regions, but can be more complicated for visualizations with heterogeneous textures because there are multiple ways to scale textures\u2014zooming or repeating texture elements. Previous work suggested that original textures were more perceptually similar to repeat-scaled rather than zoom-scaled textures. Here, we found that texture semantics was preserved after both types of enlargement, suggesting that texture semantics is robust to scaling, at least for geometric textures in which elements are visible at all scales.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"zoeshoward@gmail.com","name":"Zoe Howard"},{"affiliation":"University of Wisconsin - Madison","email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"kschloss@wisc.edu","name":"Karen Schloss"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"64c1bc8e-6529-47d5-8f6e-c194f4766ec2","image_caption":"Designers who are interested in understanding the semantics (meaning) of visual features can use our results to inform their use of texture in data visualizations.","keywords":["information visualization","perceptual semantics","visual reasoning","texture perception","visual communication"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/s7ghe/?view_only=66b92b5dd3e74ee3a231e9b4c9e786a6","open_access_supplemental_question":"The experiment stimuli, data, and analysis code are posted on OSF","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1227-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMjctZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY1fQ.JmYrtOadvstpBJ62cBZyvrjV5bY_UT6U0jv2eRbDCrM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1227-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=4d7939107790e4c48d053f959b62faf21c60a7e4f1c89782bfaeea7045f68c15","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1227-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=d2767d0dd06969ab5d7613ee15ef376efcfd7dbead294fb9055cbea5e7731acf","preprint_link":"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/4uadx_v1","program_paper_id":"1227","title":"Texture Semantics is Robust to Scaling","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:29.804015+00:00"},{"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves the topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined on flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor\u2014a multi-dimensional array of numbers \u2014 to each point in space. Tensor fields, such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific data compressors SZ3 and SPERR.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"},{"affiliation":"University of Kentucky","email":"xliang@uky.edu","name":"Xin Liang"},{"affiliation":"The Ohio State University","email":"guo.2154@osu.edu","name":"Hanqi Guo"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"wang.bei@gmail.com","name":"Bei Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"u1472279@utah.edu","name":"Nathaniel Gorski"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"84ab0ade-9529-4942-b5e1-ca953e56c880","image_caption":"The main practitioners of interest would be anybody who works with large amounts of tensor field data and employs topological applications.

To address this, we present The Agentopia Times, an educational game that teaches hallucination mitigation through active experimentation with MAS coordination strategies. The Agentopia Times simulates a newsroom where LLM agents collaborate to create data-driven narratives, with users tasked with adjusting communication protocols to manage hallucinated content.

In this paper, we examine how real-world visualizations are perceived across vision profiles through three complementary studies. Study 1 assessed how normal vision participants rated 46 visualizations shown in original and simulated red/green colorblind versions. Study 2 collected matched responses from participants with diagnosed CVD. Study 3 involved in-depth interviews exploring how users interpret, adapt to, and evaluate inaccessible designs. Across studies, we find that simulations capture directional perceptual shifts but fail to reflect the interpretive breakdowns and emotional work described by real CVD users. Factor analysis reveals two dominant perceptual dimensions: functional utility and affective experience. While normal vision participants prioritize functional clarity, CVD users rely more on structural cues and emotional resonance, particularly when color is unreliable. Qualitative insights show that perceptual breakdowns occur not only in high-interference charts but also when redundant encoding or layout scaffolding is missing. We synthesize these findings and offer empirically grounded design recommendations to guide inclusive visualization practices. Our results argue that accessibility must go beyond color correction, embracing structural clarity, redundancy, and real-user validation to ensure inclusive visual communication.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"},{"affiliation":"Northeastern University","email":"aarunku5@asu.edu","name":"Anjana Arunkumar"},{"affiliation":"Arizona State University","email":"cbryan16@asu.edu","name":"Chris Bryan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zjian115@asu.edu","name":"Zhuojun Jiang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.234481+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"093872c4-bec7-4c27-bb8e-c89465a4381b","image_caption":"This paper would be of interest to data visualization designers, UX researchers, and data scientists.

For example, \u201crough\u201d, when split according to phonemes, is decomposed as r-ou-gh (not as r-o-ugh or r-ough), where\neach group of letters corresponds to a sound. Since there are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a computational\noperation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times per minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text\nnecessary for reading. In English, the irregular relationships between groups of letters and sounds, and the wide variety of possible\ngroupings make this operation harder than in more regular languages such as Italian. If this segmentation takes a significant amount of\ntime in the process of recognizing a word, it is conceivable that providing segmentation information in the text itself could help the\nreading process by reducing its computational cost. In this paper we explore whether and how different visual interventions from the\nvisualization literature could communicate segmentation information for reading and word recognition. We ran a series of pre-registered\nlexical decision experiments with 192 participants that tested five main types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections,\nunderlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount of training, these visual interventions always slow\ndown word identification, but each to a different extent (between 32.7ms\u2014color technique\u2014and 70.7ms\u2014connection technique).\nThese findings are important because they indicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of specific training in\nthese visual interventions, accelerating the lexical decision task is unlikely.

However, when visualizations incorporate deceptive design elements\u2014such as truncated or inverted axes, unjustified 3D effects, or violations of best practices\u2014they can mislead viewers and distort understanding, spreading misinformation. While some deceptive tactics are obvious, others subtly manipulate perception while maintaining a fa\u00e7ade of legitimacy. As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret visualizations, especially by non-expert users, it is critical to understand how susceptible these models are to deceptive visual designs. In this study, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of VLMs' ability to interpret misleading visualizations. By analyzing over 16,000  responses from ten different models across eight distinct types of misleading chart designs, we demonstrate that most VLMs are deceived by them. This leads to altered interpretations of charts, despite the underlying data remaining the same. Our findings highlight the need for robust safeguards in VLMs against visual misinformation.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"York University","email":"ridwanmahbub26@gmail.com","name":"Ridwan Mahbub"},{"affiliation":"York University","email":"saidulis@yorku.ca","name":"Mohammed Saidul Islam"},{"affiliation":"York University","email":"tahmid20@yorku.ca","name":"Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar"},{"affiliation":"York University","email":"mizanurr@yorku.ca","name":"Mizanur Rahman"},{"affiliation":"University of Alberta","email":"mnayeem@ualberta.ca","name":"Mir Tafseer Nayeem"},{"affiliation":"York University","email":"enamulh@yorku.ca","name":"Enamul Hoque"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ridwanmahbub26@gmail.com","name":"Ridwan Mahbub"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.605934+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"1628b4eb-473e-4157-9d19-44990b75efc7","image_caption":"data journalists, journalists, visualization experts, visualization designers","keywords":["Misleading Visualizations","Large Language Models","Vision Language Models","Taxonomy","Evaluation"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/vis-nlp/visDeception","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1327-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzMjctZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OSwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY5fQ.LeLhSyEiAlnxdYusYhLJCT1u5mNgebND6NqBFmybxWU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1327-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=4dcc31d84c8505d24921b1e823f53423fdfce04c3f62f58e1631ad46d7860ace","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1327-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=5287fb9801ca607110c91fab3bee2807e446642e2f4fe2267ba21b5bce460de9","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1327","title":"The Perils of Chart Deception: How Misleading Visualizations Affect Vision-Language Models","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:31.703304+00:00"},{"abstract":"Advancements in accessibility technologies such as low-cost swell form printers or refreshable tactile displays promise to allow blind or low-vision (BLV) people to analyze data by transforming visual representations directly to tactile representations.\nHowever, it is possible that design guidelines derived from experiments on the visual perception system may not be suited for the tactile perception system. We investigate the potential mismatch between familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into the strategies employed by BLV people to measure common graphical primitives converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use encodings designed explicitly for BLV people.  Based on this study, we identify gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps.

Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing  time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Adobe Research","email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Sao Paulo","email":"gnonato@icmc.usp.br","name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato"},{"affiliation":"Paris Descartes University","email":"themis@mi.parisdescartes.fr","name":"Themis Palpanas"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"csilva@nyu.edu","name":"Claudio Silva"},{"affiliation":"New York University","email":"juliana.freire@nyu.edu","name":"Juliana Freire"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ychan@adobe.com","name":"Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.982997+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"8347663a-7e88-43e2-a557-e7b2179fd4e5","image_caption":"time series researchers,\nneuroscientist,\ndata scientist","keywords":["Time Series Visualization","Sub-sequence Clustering"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/GromitC/TiVy","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1930-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTkzMC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM5LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzl9.d9tLs0WVdP18T-ttWzACmcbTh0Ew8xnYrbI2Mvxw_hU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1930-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=64f089331dee262ea4dad601e27b56342c80168f94d84abfcafae5762568cb76","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1930-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=7fa80ef802f6ee324fcf9431b800f8a7a6afb932c937ef5ae01267b5e26a05db","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18972","program_paper_id":"1930","title":"TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:21.852312+00:00"},{"abstract":"We propose a design space for embedded data visualizations in urban environments, structured across multiple dimensions that articulate key contextual and representational characteristics.

This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples.\nTo address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links.

Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively.

Recent advances have introduced uncertain topological features for tensor field ensembles by focusing on degenerate tensor locations. Yet, mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces and arbitrary mode surfaces are essential to a comprehensive understanding of tensor field topology. In this work, we present a generalization of uncertain degenerate tensor features to uncertain mode surfaces of arbitrary mode values, encompassing uncertain degenerate tensor lines as a special case.

We consider PCA under the assumption that the high-dimensional data points are equipped with Gaussian uncertainty. Several approaches to such uncertainty-aware PCA have been developed recently in the visualization community. Since PCA is a discontinuous map, a small uncertainty in the data points can result in a huge uncertainty in the projected points. We show that the uncertainty of the data points also creates uncertainty in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that defines the PCA projection.

This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke-University","email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"},{"affiliation":"Otto-von-Guericke University","email":"kai.ostendorf@st.ovgu.de","name":"Kai Ostendorf"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"baeumler@stanford.edu","name":"Kathrin Baeumler"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University","email":"mastro@stanford.edu","name":"Domenico Mastrodicasa"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"d.fleischmann@stanford.edu","name":"Dominik Fleischmann"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"bernhard@isg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de","name":"Bernhard Preim"},{"affiliation":"University of Magdeburg","email":"theisel@ovgu.de","name":"Holger Theisel"},{"affiliation":"Stanford University School of Medicine","email":"gmistelb@stanford.edu","name":"Gabriel Mistelbauer"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"aar.schr@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Schroeder"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"7b762da7-ec92-461b-ab0a-95e7e278234d","image_caption":"Radiologists and vascular surgeons could discover new possibilities for the visualization of the data that is already available to them and develop new diagnostic and treatment planning strategies.

However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system\u2019s usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"},{"affiliation":"ETH Zurich","email":"vzouhar@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Vil\u00e9m Zouhar"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"robin.chan@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Robin Chan"},{"affiliation":"University of Konstanz","email":"daniel.fuerst@uni-konstanz.de","name":"Daniel F\u00fcrst"},{"affiliation":"IBM Research AI","email":"hendrik@strobelt.com","name":"Hendrik Strobelt"},{"affiliation":"ETH Z\u00fcrich","email":"melassady@ai.ethz.ch","name":"Mennatallah El-Assady"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"furui.cheng@inf.ethz.ch","name":"Furui Cheng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.194304+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"7a68a26e-4b20-444f-a76a-eee7a08ab3be","image_caption":"large language model (application) researchers and developers; \nresearchers in explainable AI and human-AI interaction","keywords":["Counterfactual","Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Large Language Model","Visualization"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":"The paper contributes an interactive visualization system for analyzing large language model behaviors together with an algorithm for meaning textual counterfactual generation.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1701-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTcwMS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0OTM4LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA5Mzh9.rf9LusEe57KY5mJV8uAa1_Azz-sQfLE2UhXKG3p4rgg","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1701-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=f62916743d240c85a5648346dd783b568ffb121c83ec4eb6242d39aec961b339","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1701-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=13876486957598f68aa9993ac41b70af20f12bf7c08e7248ff8b98d4f039d0dc","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00708","program_paper_id":"1701","title":"Understanding Large Language Model Behaviors through Interactive Counterfactual Generation and Analysis","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:22:20.337769+00:00"},{"abstract":"This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in data visualization knowledge tasks.

While researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance, contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in today\u2019s digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive visualization.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Iowa State University","email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"wangyifanlea@gmail.com","name":"Yifan Wang"},{"affiliation":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University","email":"flora20@sjtu.edu.cn","name":"Yutong Yang"},{"affiliation":"Fudan University","email":"xingyulan96@gmail.com","name":"Xingyu Lan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"daocheng@iastate.edu","name":"Daocheng Lin"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"19140b17-2652-4f77-a749-4088ec870052","image_caption":"We proposed an analysis of the visual rhetoric on the octopus maps, which is a famous persuasive visualization in history, offering insights for practitioners such as data journalists, visual designers, government communicators, and educators.

However, analyzing such data is inherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains. The need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate various analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for researchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine learning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a promising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics systems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise computational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to intent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout the design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge between user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in urban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows users to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment across the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics. Based on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates features to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks across dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of interactions. We demonstrate Urbanite's effectiveness through usage scenarios created in collaboration with urban experts.

Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"maggie.mccracken@psych.utah.edu","name":"Maggie McCracken"},{"affiliation":"University College London","email":"d.hajas@ucl.ac.uk","name":"Daniel Hajas"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"sarah.creem@psych.utah.edu","name":"Sarah Creem-Regehr"},{"affiliation":"University of Utah","email":"alexander.lex@gmail.com","name":"Alexander Lex"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"hetingying.hty@gmail.com","name":"Tingying He"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"055a075f-b15e-43ec-becb-cc09ad944d2c","image_caption":"Practitioners\n- Accessibility experts\n- Educators of blind and low-vision individuals\n- Inclusive design practitioners\n\nApplications:\n- Use our tactile chart designs to teach complex visualizations to BLV learners\n- Support development of instructional materials for BLV individuals\n- Inform inclusive design of data tools and alt text strategies","keywords":["Accessibility","tactile representations"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://osf.io/9dwgq/","open_access_supplemental_question":"We provide an extensive, well-documented 40-page appendix that includes materials and detailed descriptions of the full design and user study processes.","pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1514-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUxNC1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzR9.aSvthK_PPPti0AIDaUneLQ5TiPEpBAAehhWpc4LMq2U","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1514-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=10ec622d1df0d0f12f5bfb886cc8a5d28badae26225951d78b248fcbbf100f83","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1514-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=6aa2949cb316a67ed4ad346ce642c0fef3108ffb6d2bae1b7218ec62b1352cf0","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21462","program_paper_id":"1514","title":"Using Tactile Charts to Support Comprehension and Learning of Complex Visualizations for Blind and Low-Vision Individuals","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:15:36.644041+00:00"},{"abstract":"Designing and building visual analytics (VA) systems is a complex, iterative process that requires the seamless integration of data processing, analytics capabilities, and visualization techniques. While prior research has extensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system authoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain underexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are only a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To tackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that systematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban VA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate data and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20 systems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level structure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA system development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to automate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a corpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base construction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a quantitative analysis of annotation metrics. Our contributions provide a deeper understanding of VA systems' composition and establish a practical foundation to support more structured, reproducible, and efficient system development.

An analysis of the feasibility of using AR in journal publications for 3D visualizations took place two years ago, in 2023, when Adams et al. evaluated whether the perceived workload between AR and non-AR technologies was comparable. Given that the use of AR for astronomy journal publications was, and still is, in its infancy, the original study had to utilize data intended for K-12 education that had similar interactions and data types as a proxy for real-world data that could be visualized in future astronomy publications. In this paper, we present the results of a conceptual replication study of Adams et al.\u2019s work to validate whether their findings hold with real astronomy stimuli. We found in our replication that many of the trends in the original study hold true, but that the workload experienced by participants was significantly higher under multiple conditions when using real-world data. Additionally, we found that the tradeoff between engagement and workload was as prevalent in the replication as it was in the original study. Our results provide a new framing for researchers to understand the tradeoffs of immersive visualization technologies and the increased workload of pairing these tools with complex, scientific stimuli.

According to the originally recommended implementation, a 3D tricubic B-spline reconstruction is applied to evaluate true samples along the rays, while between the true samples, virtual samples are calculated by using a 1D Catmull-Rom spline interpolation. The virtual samples can be evaluated much faster, but they can still well approximate the true samples. Therefore, the rendering performance can be drastically improved at the cost of a very slight quality degradation. Nevertheless, in this paper, we show that the original virtual sampling scheme does not exploit the fact, that the applied tricubic B-spline reconstruction filter together with its analytic derivative filters provide Hermite samples. Therefore, it is more natural to use Hermite interpolation along the rays rather than Catmull-Rom spline interpolation. From a sampling-theoretical point of view, this modification requires half of the true samples to guarantee the same reconstruction quality. Furthermore, concerning the evaluation of the true samples, we also investigate a recently published GPU-accelerated triquadratic B-spline filtering as an alternative of the tricubic B-spline filtering.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Budapest University of Technology and Economics","email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"cseb@iit.bme.hu","name":"Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e9bfalvi"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.174731+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"be118d02-63d2-4463-a135-af2c23073ad2","image_caption":"Everybody who develops volume-rendering algorithms would be potentially interested in reading this paper.

However, the labels in most existing corpora are high-level (e.g., chart types), hindering their utility for broader applications in the era of AI. In this paper, we contribute VISANATOMY, a corpus containing 942 real-world SVG charts produced by over 50 tools, encompassing 40 chart types and featuring structural and stylistic design variations. Each chart is augmented with multi-level fine-grained labels on its semantic components, including each graphical element\u2019s type, role, and position, hierarchical groupings of elements, group layouts, and visual encodings. In total, VISANATOMY provides labels for more than 383k graphical elements. We demonstrate the richness of the semantic labels by comparing VISANATOMY with existing corpora. We illustrate its usefulness through four applications: semantic role inference for SVG elements, chart semantic decomposition, chart type classification, and content navigation for accessibility. Finally, we discuss research opportunities to further improve VISANATOMY.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"cchen24@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Chen Chen"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hbako@virginia.edu","name":"Hannah Bako"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"peihong@umd.edu","name":"Peihong Yu"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"hookerj100@gmail.com","name":"John Hooker"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"jjoyal@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Jeffrey Joyal"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"wang.c.simon@gmail.com","name":"Simon Wang"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"skim1270@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Samuel Kim"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"aprilwushuang@gmail.com","name":"Jessica Wu"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"ading1@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Aoxue Ding"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"lsandeep@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Lara Sandeep"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","email":"alexychen2002@gmail.com","name":"Alex Chen"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"csinha@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Chayanika Sinha"},{"affiliation":"University of Maryland","email":"leozcliu@umd.edu","name":"Zhicheng Liu"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"cchen24@terpmail.umd.edu","name":"Chen Chen"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.516082+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"7ecd3f2d-f7b0-4b86-aa66-248cc17c0720","image_caption":"Researchers who work on AI models for data visualizations can benefit from the paper.

While previous methods have proposed embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval (VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing. To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis, demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding visualization dissemination and information conveyance.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"huayuan221@gmail.com","name":"Huayuan Ye"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"jtchen@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Juntong Chen"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"10195102459@stu.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Shenzhuo Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Tsinghua University","email":"yp-zhang22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","name":"Yipeng Zhang"},{"affiliation":"School of Computer Science and Technology","email":"cbwang@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Changbo Wang"},{"affiliation":"East China Normal University","email":"chli@cs.ecnu.edu.cn","name":"Chenhui Li"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"huayuan221@gmail.com","name":"Huayuan Ye"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"88a99aaa-b89c-494c-b810-2113f43914ab","image_caption":"Visualization designers, publishers or general public who uses charts in daily life.","keywords":["Visualization image data retrieval","image steganography","tampering resistance","tampering detection."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1083-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTA4My1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQzNjY1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0Nzk2NjV9.zqXgObPxdLlnQAz-210OIrdifPPkQLXgx_NQkeoNEFo","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1083-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=294890b197b2c26b4fe75500aa416ba6735ff7a78ab1a4be420db2cd29772c75","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1083-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=b3ce6b31c27b1a83532b7852ad68fbcca4d78e3b3efa7cb5a3f867bdc41a6c1e","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14459","program_paper_id":"1083","title":"VisGuard: Securing Visualization Dissemination through Tamper-Resistant Data Retrieval","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:01:05.727441+00:00"},{"abstract":"Vision-language (VL) models have shown transformative potential across various critical domains due to their capability to comprehend multi-modal information. However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation.

Collectively, visualization badges aim to foster trust in visualizations and prevent readers from drawing incorrect conclusions. Based on a series of co-design workshops, we define and evaluate the concept of visualization badges and formulate a conceptual framework for analysis, application, and further research. Our framework includes a catalog of 132 visualization badges, categorization schemes, design options for their visual representations, applied visualization examples, and guidelines for their use.

Although visualization research has broadened criteria for effective design, governing\nparadigms privilege the accurate and efficient transmission of data. Drawing on theory from linguistic anthropology, we argue that such approaches\u2014focused on encoding and decoding propositional content\u2014cannot fully account for how people engage with visualizations and why particular visualizations might invite adversarial or receptive responses. In this paper, we present evidence that data visualizations communicate not only semantic, propositional meaning\u2014meaning about data\u2014but also social, indexical meaning\u2014meaning beyond data. From a series of ethnographically-informed interviews, we document how readers make rich and varied assessments of a visualization\u2019s \u201cvibes\u201d\u2014inferences about the social provenance of a visualization based on its design features. Furthermore, these social attributions have the power to influence reception, as readers\u2019 decisions about how to engage with a visualization concern not only content, or even aesthetic appeal, but also their sense of alignment or disalignment with the entities they imagine to be involved in its production and circulation. We argue these inferences hinge on a function of human sign systems that has thus far been little studied in data visualization: socio-indexicality, whereby the formal features (rather than the content) of communication evoke social contexts, identities, and characteristics. Demonstrating the presence and significance of this socio-indexical function in visualization, this paper offers both a conceptual foundation and practical intervention for troubleshooting breakdowns in public data communication.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"mjmorgen@mit.edu","name":"Michelle Morgenstern"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Fox"},{"affiliation":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":"gmj@mit.edu","name":"Graham Jones"},{"affiliation":"MIT","email":"arvindsatya@mit.edu","name":"Arvind Satyanarayan"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"amyraefoxphd@gmail.com","name":"Amy Rae Fox"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.409362+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"6a8c1148-d065-4251-9183-2955b9445817","image_caption":"Practitioners involved in communicating scientific data to general publics would be interested in reading this paper.

The system also supports more accessible communication of climate data, helping non-experts better grasp the dynamics and implications of Earth system models.","keywords":["visual analytics","design study climate model"],"open_access_supplemental_link":"https://github.com/datavisprogram/climascope","open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1113-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzExMTMtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NTkzOCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgxOTM4fQ.KP01XFXzVjCT0Hw8Jmgn_Q7fZC7TcmLE65vNkVRy1YI","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1113-cam-i10.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=51b16e826e238471c10f97057764cbe1d8dd79e70afa4ce7b5c6a360f6a43181","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1113-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=1361a5cd7149fb2045b8c80e6b4e9198909d6da9f03f9b91c735e7adbc9039a2","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1113","title":"Visualizing Climate Model Outputs with CliMAScope","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:38:59.800702+00:00"},{"abstract":"Smartwatches increasingly serve as daily data analysis tools, yet their visualization designs face unique challenges: small screens, diverse dial shapes (round/square), and mobile usage contexts (sitting/walking).

In a user study with 382 participants from the Netherlands, we assessed their effects on vote choice, political knowledge, ease of use, and interpretation of opinion space. The results show no evidence that visualization and interaction mechanisms influence vote choice. The metaphoric map led to lower perceived and factual political knowledge and was harder to interpret, likely due to its higher visualization literacy demands. Notably, participants using metaphoric map offered more objective, non-ideological interpretations of their political position, suggesting potential to foster unbiased political comprehension.

Conversely, poorly designed visualizations can impede comprehension, introduce interpretive bias, and diminish the perceived credibility of the conveyed message. This paper investigates the extent to which visual embellishments influence perceived message credibility in data visualizations. We conducted two crowdsourced experiments to examine both holistic and component-level effects of embellishment. In the first experiment, participants evaluated the relative credibility of plain bar charts versus two embellished variants\u2014cartoon-style and image-style\u2014across topics. Participants provided both comparative judgments and qualitative feedback. In the second experiment, we systematically isolated the influence of specific design elements\u2014color, font, and bar style\u2014on credibility perceptions through controlled variations. Our findings reveal that the impact of embellishments on perceived message credibility is complex and context-dependent. While certain embellishments, such as the use of color and image style bars, enhanced credibility, others\u2014most notably hand-drawn fonts and cartoon-style bars\u2014significantly undermined it. By operationalizing trust through the lens of message credibility, this work offers empirical insight into the design factors that shape viewers' perceptions.

Users initially access core functionalities\u2014such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis\u2014through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system\u2019s adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., \u201cvisualize the skull\u201d or \u201chighlight tissue boundaries\u201d). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"ayanju04@gmail.com","name":"Ayan Biswas"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National

tomographic reconstruction that supports real-time volume generation and volumetric motion visualization from 2D projections. Visualizing the motion of 3D anatomical structures, such as organs and tumors, is critical for computer-aided interventions. However, conventional 4D volumetric reconstruction methods typically produce a limited set of volumes at discrete phases, suffering from low temporal resolution. Moreover, it often requires extensive segmentation of 3D structures or regions for visualizing volumetric data, making it challenging to segment and visualize dynamic volumes in real-time. To address these challenges, VolMoVis framework employs a continuous implicit neural representation that decomposes the dynamic volumetric data into a static reference volume and a continuous deformation field. This decomposition, along with an efficient deformation network, enables our framework to achieve real-time volume generation and volumetric visualization of continuous anatomical motions. We evaluate VolMoVis on both 4D digital phantoms and real patient datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate anatomical reconstruction and motion tracking. Furthermore, we highlight its capabilities in real-time simultaneous volume generation and tumor segmentation for visualizing dynamic volumes and 4D tumor tracking, showcasing its potential in image-guided radiation therapy.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ari@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Arie Kaufman"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"dgaofeng@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Gaofeng Deng"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"f84ebbf0-98bb-4a65-9640-3161c7449f60","image_caption":"This paper will be of interest to medical physicist, radiation oncologists, radiologist, and visualization practitioners working with dynamic anatomical data.

To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"},{"affiliation":"University of Notre Dame","email":"chaoli.wang@nd.edu","name":"Chaoli Wang"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"syao2@nd.edu","name":"Siyuan Yao"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.875441+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"3d97e8c0-6d8b-4fe5-aa06-3ddf284b1a45","image_caption":"Practitioners who would be interested in this paper:\n- Simulation scientists\n- Visualization researchers\n- Computer graphics and vision researchers\n- Medical imaging specialists\n- Data scientists working with 3D or time-varying data\n\nHow they can apply it:\n- Simulation scientists can visualize large, time-varying datasets in real time on low-end machines.\n- Visualization researchers can build on the segmentation and tracking methods for dynamic scenes.\n- Graphics and vision researchers can use the deformable 3D Gaussians for efficient scene representation.\n- Medical imaging specialists can adapt the segmentation methods for CT/MRI data.\n- Data scientists can apply the tracking tools to monitor changes in dynamic 3D datasets.","keywords":["Volume visualization","novel view synthesis","scene segmentation","segment tracking","deformable Gaussian splatting"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1535-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUzNS1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM1LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzV9.EiKp6ljr8N-pX5aUmGDFoG3rW34Fei_dr1TCgGmEK-k","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1535-cam-i10.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=c97f51377ecc2e0190f6ee0cdc6e57033b26d99c7438299951131e7f9791e6d3","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1535-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=c58889b55ece2c985848c74c5d01943d6ab3c6caf37fe3b274e2f7d2733a322e","preprint_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12667","program_paper_id":"1535","title":"VolSegGS: Segmentation and Tracking in Dynamic Volumetric Scenes via Deformable 3D Gaussians","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:15:37.560459+00:00"},{"abstract":"Within the nucleus of a cell, the genetic material (DNA) is condensed, supercoiled, and wrapped around proteins called histones, so to form chromatin. Unlike its traditional visualization, the organization of chromatin is 3D and can be measured with whole-genome sequencing technologies such as Hi-C sequencing, the results of which are often graphically represented as flat 2D heat-maps or a 1D curve that looks like a hairball. Here we discuss a novel approach to represent these and other genomic data by transforming the visualization of the genome from a 1D curve embedded in 3D into a structured 3D volume. This abstraction prioritizes 3D spatial proximity of chromatin and enables advanced techniques like clipping, thresholding, and contouring. Our method allows for multi-variable encoding, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret multivariate relationships, offering a more complete and effective representation of genomic structures, chromosome organization, and data relationships.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Roxana Bujack"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"dhr@lanl.gov","name":"David Rogers"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"croth@lanl.gov","name":"Cullen Roth"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"emsmall@lanl.gov","name":"Eric Small"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"baners4@lanl.gov","name":"Banerjee Shounak"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"vrindavenu7@gmail.com","name":"Vrinda Venu"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"shawns@lanl.gov","name":"Shawn Starkenburg"},{"affiliation":"Los Alamos National Laboratory","email":"crsteadman@lanl.gov","name":"Steadman, Christina Rene"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"bujack@lanl.gov","name":"Dr. Roxana Bujack"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.501591+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"cab72096-2336-4e27-a4e2-c416dd102259","image_caption":"biologists, genomics researchers, epigenomics researchers","keywords":["Genome","volume","DNA","3D Hi-C","volumetric","abstraction."],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1220-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEyMjAtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY4fQ.d0t5C-Qzdr24boBak8YXCmE2mMlvBC_fKz3HnMXo5dQ","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1220-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=8155edc26f33574387bb2ece9042fa8180a3058f3398d028608b8a35dab23e7a","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1220-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=a55529b365a131963f3f8a0752d60adb144c90601d6f7aea77a54b0db0e61bdd","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1220","title":"Volumetric Visualization of the Genome","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:30.851331+00:00"},{"abstract":"This paper introduces a timeline authoring tool that integrates Augmented Reality and tablet-based spatial interaction, enabling users to create large-scale non-linear timelines by leveraging spatial cognition and embodied interaction.

In this paper, we investigate how language models, including Word2Vec, RoBERTa, GPT-4o mini and the vision language model CLIP generate and represent nuanced semantically resonant colors for diverse concepts. To achieve this, we utilized a large dataset of color names and concepts, tailored models for the structure of each language model, and developed an interactive web interface, CONCEPT2COLOR, as a use case. Additionally, we conducted experiments and a detailed analysis to assess the ability of these models to generate meaningful colors. Through these experiments, we examined how factors such as model design, training data and context affect the color output. Our findings reveal the capabilities and limitations of language models in processing and generating semantically resonant colors for concepts, thus contributing insights into how they depict semantic color-concept connections. These insights have implications for data visualization, design, and human-computer interaction, where leveraging effective semantic color generation can enhance communication and user experience.","accessible_pdf":null,"authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"tpial@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Tanzir Pial"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"ssalimaunti@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Shahreen Salim"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.091399+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"b00813fe-c0fb-4bdb-8040-b6e338088247","image_caption":"This work will be of interest to anyone who needs to pick or evaluate color palettes for communication and design, including:\n\nInformation & Data Visualization Designers (in academia or industry), who want to automatically generate palettes that align with the semantics of their data categories.\n\nData Journalists & Reporters, who need on-the-fly, context-aware colors for charts and infographics to make stories more intuitive and engaging.\n\nUI/UX Designers & Front-end Developers, who can use semantic color mapping to theme components (alerts, statuses, notifications) based on message content or user sentiment.\n\nEducators & Instructional Designers, who create learning materials or e-learning modules and want color cues that reinforce key concepts or vocabulary.\n\nBranding & Marketing Professionals, who often start from keywords like \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ceco-friendly\u201d and need to translate those into on-brand color palettes quickly.\n\nAccessibility & Assistive-Tech Specialists, who can augment communication aids (e.g., emotion cards, schedules) with semantically meaningful colors to reduce ambiguity for neurodivergent or visually impaired users.","keywords":["Tabular Data","Text/Document Data","Datasets","Methodologies","Software Prototype","Domain Agnostic","Color Machine Learning Techniques"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-full/1506-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LWZ1bGwvMTUwNi1kb2MucGRmIiwiaWF0IjoxNzYwOTQ0NTM0LCJleHAiOjE3OTI0ODA1MzR9.RHtQ9p5gLNhMyIaq_A8fOEoBvyhNpndUme-jCO9KsVM","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1506-cam-i10.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=a0563fc75f1be47c8d1d07f98dfa145d9a5e4e3b43abfe4764e1a3d959b6387d","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25a/vis25a-sub1506-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250815%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250815T054743Z&X-Amz-Signature=430c2427d29912a5999a2fd5edd4f902fedc6dee04be4156d79edd5709ccbba6","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1506","title":"What is the Color of Serendipity?

We collected VC scores through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800 visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12 image-based metrics spanning pixel-based and statistic-information-theoretic (clutter), color, shape, and our two new object-based metrics (meaningful-color-count (MeC) and text-to-ink ratio (TiR)). Our results show that both low-level edges and high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; the number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, a statistical information-theoretic metric capturing color and texture patterns, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same continuous color/texture stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for texts: increasing TiR initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases VC. Our quantification model is also interpretable - enabling metric-based explanations - grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses.

However, mapping the relationship between design choices and reader conclusions often requires labor-intensive crowdsourced studies, generating large corpora of free-response text for analysis. To address this challenge, we explored alternative scalable research methodologies to assess chart affordances. We test four elicitation methods from human-subject studies: free response, visualization ranking, conclusion ranking, and salience rating, and compare their effectiveness in eliciting reader interpretations of line charts, dot plots, and heatmaps. Overall, we find that while no method fully replicates affordances observed in free-response conclusions, combinations of ranking and rating methods can serve as an effective proxy at a broad scale. The two ranking methodologies were influenced by participant bias towards certain chart types and the comparison of suggested conclusions. Rating conclusion salience could not capture the specific variations between chart types observed in the other methods. To supplement this work, we present a case study with GPT-4o, exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) to elicit human-like chart interpretations. This aligns with recent academic interest in leveraging LLMs as proxies for human participants to improve data collection and analysis efficiency. GPT-4o performed best as a human proxy for the salience rating methodology but suffered from severe constraints in other areas. Overall, the discrepancies in affordances we found between various elicitation methodologies, including GPT-4o, highlight the importance of intentionally selecting and combining methods and evaluating trade-offs.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of California Berkeley","email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","name":"Chase Stokes"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Institute of Technology","email":"klin368@gatech.edu","name":"Kylie Lin"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"chase_stokes@berkeley.edu","name":"Chase Stokes"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:03.301642+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"4cf2c4a7-98c7-4d49-a5c2-410ecde134cb","image_caption":"Practitioners who compare alternative designs (e.g., user experience researchers) would be interested in reading this paper, since it discusses the trade offs and different findings from different methodologies.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of XplainAct through two case studies: investigating opioid-related deaths in epidemiology and analyzing voting inclinations in the presidential election.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"yanming.zhang@stonybrook.edu","name":"Yanming Zhang"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"khegde@cs.stonybrook.edu","name":"Krishnakumar Hegde"},{"affiliation":"Stony Brook University","email":"mueller@cs.sunysb.edu","name":"Klaus Mueller"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"yanming.zhang@stonybrook.edu","name":"Yanming Zhang"}],"created_at":"2025-10-15T04:55:17.714397+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-short","fno":null,"has_ff":true,"has_image":true,"has_pdf":true,"id":"258e8105-5eb0-4316-99bc-40522d2b6d15","image_caption":"1.Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers\nApplication: They can integrate XplainAct\u2019s ideas into their own pipelines to interpret and validate models more effectively, especially in applications where local explanations are as important as global patterns.\n\n2.Public Health Researchers and Epidemiologists\nApplication: Use XplainAct to identify region-specific or subgroup-specific causal drivers and simulate policy interventions (e.g., improving mental health resources) in a way that accounts for local heterogeneity.\n\n3.Political Analysts and Social Scientists\nApplication: Campaign strategists or sociopolitical researchers can simulate policy changes or demographic shifts and assess how they might influence election outcomes in targeted regions.","keywords":["Explainable AI","Causality","Visual Analytics"],"open_access_supplemental_link":null,"open_access_supplemental_question":null,"pdf_url":"https://data.tech.ieeevis.org/storage/v1/object/sign/vis2025/pdf-files/v-short/1350-doc.pdf?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJ2aXMyMDI1L3BkZi1maWxlcy92LXNob3J0LzEzNTAtZG9jLnBkZiIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk0NjU2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzkyNDgyNTY2fQ.gZ-RCVAme52nVWTFg3J5i_UXmyxP42BTj8QdBKLYPXU","pmu_retrieve_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1350-cam-i10.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=980ce4069f9c3baac59eed92f410c6f71e90b28b481248204bc79f59be84fdb8","pmu_upload_link":"https://0d2f0bc53ec40041bef323f40496ed3c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/pcs/vis25b/vis25b-sub1350-cam-i7.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=7200&X-Amz-Credential=8c3c5bf11286f4699c7019eaeac51dfe%2F20250812%2Fenam%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Date=20250812T062640Z&X-Amz-Signature=b498731647c8444d11a8935e100112ffd10b8a50322af1c3a41ac35ea69dc63c","preprint_link":null,"program_paper_id":"1350","title":"XplainAct: Visualization for Personalized Intervention Insights","updated_at":"2025-10-20T07:49:30.009635+00:00"},{"abstract":"You Only Have Seven Seconds is a cinematic artistic visualization derived from an interactive AI art installation (ReCollection) that explores how machine intelligence can reassemble collective human memory through language input.

Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders\u2019 trust in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models\u2019 behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics. We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools (LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations increase people\u2019s perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension, increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design, significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work advances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically investigates visualization\u2019s role in facilitating responsible ML applications.","accessible_pdf":"Accessible","authors":[{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","email":"zhannakaufma@umass.edu","name":"Zhanna Kaufman"},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Amherst","email":"mendres@umass.edu","name":"Madeline Endres"},{"affiliation":"Georgia Tech","email":"cxiong@gatech.edu","name":"Cindy Xiong Bearfield"},{"affiliation":"University of Massachusetts","email":"brun@cs.umass.edu","name":"Yuriy Brun"}],"award":null,"contributors":[{"email":"zhannakaufma@umass.edu","name":"Zhanna Kaufman"}],"created_at":"2025-10-09T07:48:02.549263+00:00","doi":null,"event_prefix":"v-full","fno":null,"has_ff":false,"has_image":false,"has_pdf":true,"id":"1b3b1b15-e378-4c65-8984-717a7f7baa3a","image_caption":"Data scientists, developers who work with machine learning systems, and developers or researchers working in ML explainability would be interested in reading this paper.
